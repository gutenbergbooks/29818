<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>BULLY PRESBY</h3>
</div>
<p>Plainly the rambling log structure was a
road house and the stopping place for a
mountain stage. It had the watering
trough in front, the bundle of iron pails cluttered
around the rusted iron pump, and the trampled
muddy hollow created by many tired hoofs striking
vigorously to drive away the flies. It was in a
tiny flat beside the road, and mountains were
everywhere; hard-cut, relentless giants, whose
stern faces portrayed a perpetual constancy. At
the trough two burros, with their packs deftly
lashed, thrust soft gray muzzles deep into the
water, and held rigid their long gray ears, casting
now and then a wise look at the young man in
worn mining clothes who stood patiently beside
them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>Another man, almost a giant in size, but with
a litheness of movement that told of marvelous
physical strength, emerged from the door of the
road house, and the babel of sound that had been
stilled when he entered, but a few minutes before,
rose again. He crossed to the well, and smiled
from half-humorous eyes at the younger man
standing beside the animals, and said: &ldquo;Bumped
into a hornet&rsquo;s nest. Butted into an indignation
meetin&rsquo;. A Blackfoot war powwow when the
trader had furnished free booze would have been
a peace party put up against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger man, who had turned to pump
more water, following the polite mountain custom
of replenishing for what you have used,
stopped with a hand on the handle, and looked at
him inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems it&rsquo;s a bunch of fellers that&rsquo;s been
workin&rsquo; some placer ground off back here somewheres&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and
he waved a tanned hand indefinitely
in a wide arc&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and some man got the
double hitch on &rsquo;em with the law, provin&rsquo; that
the ground was his&rsquo;n, and the sheriff run &rsquo;em off!
Now they&rsquo;re sore. But it seems they cain&rsquo;t help
&rsquo;emselves, so they&rsquo;re movin&rsquo; over to some other
place across the divide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has that to do with us?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, except that it took me five minutes
to get the barkeep&rsquo; to tell me about the road. He
says we&rsquo;ve come all right this far, and this is the
place where we hit the trail over the hills. Says
we save a day and a half, with pack burros, by
takin&rsquo; the cut-off. Says it&rsquo;s seven or eight hours
good ridin&rsquo; by the road if we were on horses
and in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and scanned the hills with an
observant eye, while his companion resumed the
pumping process. The trough again filled, the
latter walked around the pails and joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where does this trail start in?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to show us as soon as he can get
a minute&rsquo;s rest from that bunch in there. Said
we&rsquo;d have to be shown. Said unless he could get
away long enough we&rsquo;d have to wait till somebody
he named came in, and he&rsquo;d head us into
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They led the burros across the road and into
the shadow of a cliff where the morning sun,
searching and fervid, did not reach, and threw
themselves to the ground, resting their backs
against the foot wall, and trying patiently to
await the appearance of their guides. The
steady, hurried clink of glass and bottle on bar,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
the ribald shouts and threats of the crowd that
filled the road house, the occasional burst of a
maudlin song, all told the condition of the ejected
placer men who had stopped here on their journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about the case, of
course,&rdquo; drawled the big man lazily, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
none of my funeral; but it does seem as if this
feller they call &lsquo;Bully&rsquo; is quite some for havin&rsquo;
him own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed softly as if remembering scraps of
conversation he had segregated from the murmur
inside, and rolled his long body over until
he rested on his belly with the upper part of his
torso raised on his elbows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears that the courts down at the county
seat gave a decision in his favor, and that he lost
about as much time gettin&rsquo; action as a hornet
does when he&rsquo;s come to a conclusion. He just
shows up with the sheriff, and about twenty
deputies, good and true, and says: &lsquo;Hike!
The courts say it&rsquo;s mine. These is the sheriffs.
Off you go, and don&rsquo;t waste no time doin&rsquo; it,
either!&rsquo; And so they hikes and have got this
far, where they lay over for the night to comfort
their insides with somethin&rsquo; that smelled like a
cross between nitric acid, a corn farm, and sump
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
water. And it don&rsquo;t seem to cheer &rsquo;em up much,
either, because their talk&rsquo;s right ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you said they were heading
for some other ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are, but they&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; their time on
the road. I used to be that way till the day
Arizona Bill plugged me because I was slow, all
through havin&rsquo; stopped at a place too long.
Then, says I, when I woke up a month later in
the Widder Haskins&rsquo; back room: &lsquo;Bill, this
comes from corn and rye. Never have nothin&rsquo;
to do with a farmer, or anything that comes from
a farmer, after this; or some day, when your
hand ain&rsquo;t quick enough, and things look kind of
hazy, some quarrelsome man&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to shoot first
and you&rsquo;ll cash in.&rsquo; And from that day to this,
when I want to go on a bust, I drink a gallon of
soda pop to have a rip-roarin&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man lurched out of the door of the road
house as if striving to find clean air, and stood
leaning against one of the pole posts supporting
a pole porch. Another one joined him, coarsely
accusing him of being a &ldquo;quitter&rdquo; because he
had left his drink on the bar. They were stubbornly
passing words when, from down the road,
there came the gritting of wheels over the pulverized
stone, and the clacking of horses&rsquo; hoofs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
slow moving, as if being rested by a cautious
driver along the ascent.</p>
<p>The man by the post suddenly frowned in the
direction of the sound, and then whirled back to
the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bully!&rdquo; he bellowed so loudly that his
words were plainly audible to the partners lying
in the shadow. &ldquo;Bully&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo; up the road
right now! Let&rsquo;s get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a fierce, bawling chorus of shouts
that outdid anything preceding, and the door
seemed to vomit men in all stages of intoxication,
who came heavily out with their boots stamping
across the boards of the porch. They cursed,
imprecated, shook their fists, and threatened, as
they surged into the road and looked down it
toward the approaching driver. The men in the
shade got quickly to their feet, interested spectators,
and the burros awoke from their drowsy
somnolence, and turned inquiring, soft eyes on
their owners.</p>
<p>Calmly driven up toward the mob in the road
came a mountain buckboard drawn by two sweating
horses. In the seat was a man who drove
as if the reins were completely in control. He
appeared to be stockily built, and his shoulders&ndash;&ndash;broad,
heavy, and high&ndash;&ndash;had, even in that posture,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the unmistakable stamp of one who is
accustomed to stooping his way through drifts
and tunnels. He wore a black slouch hat, which
had been shaped by habitual handling to shade
his eyes. His hair was white; his neck short and
thick, with a suggestion of bull-like power and
force. His face, as he approached to closer
range, showed firm and masterful. His nose was
dominant&ndash;&ndash;the nose of a conqueror who overrides
all obstacles. He came steadily forward,
without in the least changing his attitude, or betraying
anxiety, or haste. The men in the road
waited, squarely across his path, and their hoarse
fulminations had died away to a far more terrifying
silence; yet he did not seem to heed them
as his horses advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad! Doesn&rsquo;t he know who they are?&rdquo; the
bigger man by the rock mumbled to his partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t he has a supreme nerve,&rdquo; the
younger man replied. &ldquo;They look to me as if
they mean trouble. They&rsquo;re in a pretty nasty
temper&ndash;&ndash;what with all the poison they&rsquo;ve poured
in, and all the injustice they believe they have
met. Wonder who&rsquo;s right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout from the crowd in the roadway interrupted
any further speculation. The man who
had first appeared on the road-house porch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
threw up his hand, and roared, &ldquo;Here he is!
We&rsquo;ve got him! It&rsquo;s the Bully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shout was taken up by others until a miniature
forest of raised fists shook themselves
threateningly at the man in the buckboard who
was now within a few feet of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a rope, somebody! Hang him!&rdquo; yelled
an excited voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the goods,&rdquo; screamed another,
heard above the turmoil. &ldquo;Up with the Bully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men sprang forward, and caught the
horses by their bits, and brought them to an excited,
nervous stop, and the others began to surround
the wagon. The man in the seat made no
movement, but sat there with a hard smile on his
firm lips. The partners stepped to the top of a
convenient rock, where they could overlook the
meeting, and watched, perturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about this,&rdquo; the elder said
doubtfully. &ldquo;Looks to me like there&rsquo;s too many
against one, and I ain&rsquo;t sure whether he deserves
hangin&rsquo;. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait and see. Then, if they get too
ugly, we&rsquo;ll give them a talk and try to find out,&rdquo;
the younger man answered.</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, a man came running from
the door of the road house with a coil in his hand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
and began to assert drunkenly: &ldquo;Here it is!
I&rsquo;ve got it! A rope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners were preparing to jump forward
and protest, when a most astonishing change took
place. The man in the wagon suddenly stood up,
stretched his hand commandingly to the men
holding the horses&rsquo; heads, and ordered: &ldquo;Let
go of my horses there, you drunken idiots! Let
go of them, I say, or I&rsquo;ll come down there and
make you! Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men at the horses&rsquo; heads wavered under
that harsh, firm command, but did not release
their hold. Without any further pause, the man
jumped from his buckboard squarely into the
road, struck the man holding the rope a sweeping
side blow that toppled him over like a sprawling
dummy, jerked the coil from his hands, and
tore toward his horses&rsquo; heads. As if each feared
to bar his advance, the men of the mob made
way for him, taken by surprise. He brought the
coil of rope with a stinging, whistling impact
into the face of the nearest man, who, blinded,
threw his hands upward across his eyes and
reeled back. The man at the other horse&rsquo;s head
suddenly turned and dove out of reach, but the
whistling coils again fell, lashing him across his
head and shoulders.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>Without any appearance of haste, and as if
scornful of the mob that had so recently been
threatening to hang him, the man walked back
to his buckboard, climbed in, and stood there on
his feet with the reins in one hand, and the rope
in the other. &ldquo;You get away from in front of
me there,&rdquo; he said, in his harsh, incisive voice;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of child&rsquo;s play. If you don&rsquo;t let me
alone, I&rsquo;ll kill a few of you. Now, clear out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men around him were already backing
farther away, and at this threat they opened the
road in such haste that one or two of them
nearly ran over others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; admiringly commented the big
observer on the rock, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d play hob helpin&rsquo;
him out. He don&rsquo;t need help, that feller don&rsquo;t.
If I ever saw a man that could take care of himself&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly is the one!&rdquo; his companion
finished the sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who does this rope belong to?&rdquo; demanded
the hard-faced victor in the buckboard, looking
around him.</p>
<p>No one appeared eager to claim proprietorship.
He gave a loud, contemptuous snort, and
threw the rope far over toward the road house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it!&rdquo; he called, in his cold, unemotional
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
voice. &ldquo;Some of you might want to cheat the
sheriff by hanging yourselves. After this, any or
all of you had better keep away from me. I
might lose my temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down in the seat with a deliberate effort
to show his scorn, picked the reins up more firmly,
glanced around at the rear of his buckboard to
see that his parcels were safe, ignored the cowed
men, and without ever looking at them started
his horses forward. As they began a steady trot
and passed the partners, he swept over them one
keen, searching look, as if wondering whether
they had been of the mob, turned back to observe
their loaded burros, apparently decided they had
taken no part in the affair, and bestowed on them
a faint, dry smile as he settled himself into his
seat. At the bend of the road he had not deigned
another look on the men who had been ravening
to lynch him. He drove away as carelessly as if
he alone were the only human being within miles,
and the partners gave a gasp of enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! What a man!&rdquo; exclaimed the
elder, and his companion answered in an equally
admiring tone: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he, though! Just look at
these desperadoes, will you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With shuffling feet some of them were turning
back toward the inviting door in which the bartender
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
stood with his dirty apron knotted into a
string before him. Some of the more voluble
were accusing the others of not having supported
them, and loudly expounding the method of
attack that would have been successful. The
man with red welts across his face was swearing
that if he ever got a chance he would &ldquo;put a
rifle ball through Bully.&rdquo; The young man by
the rock grinned and said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about
as close as he would ever dare come to that fellow.
Shoot him through the back at a half-mile
range!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bartender suddenly appeared to remember
the travelers, and ran across the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, gents,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t do
more to show you the way, but you see how it is.
Go up there to that big rock that looks like a
bear&rsquo;s head, then angle off south-east, and you&rsquo;ll
find a trail. When you come to any crossin&rsquo;s,
don&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em, but keep straight on, and bimeby,
about to-morrer, if you don&rsquo;t camp too long to-night,
you&rsquo;ll see a peak&ndash;&ndash;high it is&ndash;&ndash;with a
yellow mark on it, like a cross. Can&rsquo;t miss it.
Right under it&rsquo;s the Croix Mine. You leave the
trail to cross a draw, look down, and there you
are. So long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and ran back across the road in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
response to brawling shouts from the men whose
thirst seemed to have been renewed by their
encounter with the masterful man they called
&ldquo;Bully,&rdquo; and the partners, glad to escape from
such a place, headed their animals upward into
the hills.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE CROIX D&rsquo;OR</h3>
</div>
<p>It was the day after the halt at the road house.
Half-obliterated by the d&eacute;bris of snowslide
and melting torrents, the trail was hard to
follow. In some places the pack burros scrambled
for a footing or skated awkwardly with tiny
hoofs desperately set to check their descent, to
be steadied and encouraged by the booming voice,
deep as a bell, of the man nearest them. Sometimes
in dangerous spots where shale slides
threatened to prove unstable, his lean, grim face
and blue-gray eyes appeared apprehensive, and
he braced his great shoulders against one of the
bulging packs to assist a sweating, straining animal.
After one of these perilous tracts he
stopped beside the burros, pushed the stained
white Stetson to the back of his head, exposing a
white forehead which had been protected from
the sun, and ran the sleeve of his blue-flannel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
shirt across his face from brow to chin to wipe
away the moisture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s got no worse roads than this!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;Next time anybody talks me into
takin&rsquo; a cut-off over a spring trail to save a day
and a half&rsquo;s time, him and me&rsquo;ll have an argument!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead, and at the moment inspecting a knot
in a diamond hitch, the other man grinned, then
straightened up, and, shading his eyes from the
sun with his hat, looked off into the distance. He
was younger than his partner, whose hair was
grizzled to a badger gray, but no less determined
and self-reliant in appearance. He did not look
his thirty years, while the other man looked more
than his forty-eight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bill,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;it seems to me
if we can get through at all we&rsquo;ve saved a day
and a half. By the way, come up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grizzled prospector walked up until he
stood abreast, and from the little rise stared
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that it?&rdquo; asked the younger man.
&ldquo;Over there&ndash;&ndash;through the gap; just down below
that spike with a snow cap.&rdquo; He stretched
out a long, muscular arm, and his companion
edged up to it and sighted along its length and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
over the index finger as if it were the barrel of
a rifle, and stared, scowling, at the distant maze
of mountain and sky that seemed upended from
the green of the forests below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I believe you&rsquo;re right, Dick!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I believe you are. Let&rsquo;s hustle along
to the top of this divide, and then we&rsquo;ll know for
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They resumed their progress, to halt at the top,
where there was abruptly opened below them a
far-flung panorama of white and gray and purple,
stretched out in prodigality from sky line to
sky line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there she is, Dick,&rdquo; asserted the elder
man. &ldquo;That yellow, cross-shaped mark up
there on the side of the peak. I kept tellin&rsquo; you
to keep patient and we&rsquo;d get there after a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His partner did not reply to the inconsistency
of this argument, but stood looking at the landmark
as if dreaming of all it represented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is it, undoubtedly,&rdquo; he said, as if to
himself. &ldquo;The Croix d&rsquo;Or. I suppose that&rsquo;s
why the old Frenchman who located the mine
in the first place gave it that name&ndash;&ndash;the Cross
of Gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! It looks to me, from what I&rsquo;ve
heard of it,&rdquo; growled the older prospector, &ldquo;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
the Double Cross would have been a heap more
fittin&rsquo; name for it. It&rsquo;s busted everybody that
ever had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger man laughed softly and remonstrated:
&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s the use in saying
that? It wasn&rsquo;t the Croix d&rsquo;Or that broke my
father&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his half in it was all he had left when
he died!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, and it is true that he sunk more
than a hundred thousand in it; but it was the
stock-market that got him. Besides, how about
Sloan, my father&rsquo;s old-time partner? He&rsquo;s not
broke, by a long shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came the grumbling response, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
not busted, just because he had sense enough to
lay his hand down when he&rsquo;d gone the limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay his hand down? Say, Bill, you&rsquo;re a
little twisted, aren&rsquo;t you? Better go back over
the last month or two and think it over. We,
being partners, are working up in the C&oelig;ur
d&rsquo;Alenes. Our prospect pinches out. We&rsquo;ve
got just seven hundred left between us on the day
we bring the drills and hammers back, throw
them in the corner of the cabin, and say &lsquo;We&rsquo;re
on a dead one. What next?&rsquo; Then we get the
letter saying that my father, whom I haven&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
seen in ten years, nor heard much of, owing to
certain things, is dead, and that all he left was
his half of the Croix d&rsquo;Or. The letter comes
from whom? Sloan! And it says that although
he and my father, owing to father&rsquo;s abominable
temper, had not been intimate for a year or two,
he still respected his memory, and wanted to befriend
his son. Didn&rsquo;t he? Then he said that
he had enough belief left in the Croix d&rsquo;Or to
back it for a hundred thousand more, if I, being
a practical miner, thought well of it. Do you
call that laying down a hand? Humph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder man finished rolling a cigarette, and
then looked at him with twinkling, whimsical
eyes, as if continuing the argument merely for
the sake of debate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he thinks it&rsquo;s such a good thing,
why didn&rsquo;t he offer to buy you out? Why didn&rsquo;t
they work her sooner? She&rsquo;s been idle, and
water-soaked, for three years, ain&rsquo;t she? As
sure as your name&rsquo;s Dick Townsend, and mine&rsquo;s
Bill Mathews, that old feller back East don&rsquo;t
think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to say it&rsquo;s all right. He knows
all about you! He knows you don&rsquo;t stand for
no lies or crooked work, and are a fool for principle,
like a bee that goes and sticks his stinger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
into somethin&rsquo; even though he knows he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to kill himself by doin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know he ain&rsquo;t figurin&rsquo; it
this way: &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll send Dick Townsend down
there to look at it. He&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s no good. Then
I&rsquo;ll buy him out and unload this Cross of Gold
hole and plant it on some tenderfoot and get
mine back!&rsquo; You cain&rsquo;t make me believe in any
of those Wall Street fellers! They all deal from
the bottom of the deck and keep shoemaker&rsquo;s
wax on their cuff buttons to steal the lone ace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if giving the lie to his growling complaints
and pessimism, he laughed with a bellowing
cachinnation that prompted the burros, now
rested, to look at him with long gray ears thrust
forward curiously, and wonder at his noise.</p>
<p>Townsend appeared to comprehend that his
partner was but half in earnest, and smiled good-humoredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bill,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if the mine&rsquo;s not full
of water or bad air, so that we can&rsquo;t form any
idea at all, we&rsquo;ll not be long in saying what we
think of it. We ought to be there in an hour
from now. Let&rsquo;s hike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They began the slow, plodding gait of the
packer again, finding it easier now that they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
on the crest of a divide where the trail was less
obstructed and firmer, and the yellow lines on
the peak, their goal, came more plainly into view.
The cross resolved itself into a peculiar slide of
oxidized earth traversing two gullies, and the
arm of the cross no longer appeared true to the
perpendicular. The tall tamaracks began to
segregate as the travelers dropped to a lower
altitude; and pine and fir, fragrant with spring
odor, seemed watching them. The trail at last
took an abrupt turn away from the cross-marked
mountain, and they came to another halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be where they told us to turn off
through the woods and down the slope, I think,&rdquo;
said Townsend. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem so to you,
Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old prospector frowned off toward the
top of the peak now high above them, and then,
with the peculiar farsightedness of an outdoor
man of the West, looked around at the horizon
as if calculating the position of the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be any use to
keep on the trail now. We&rsquo;d better go to the
right. They said we&rsquo;d come to a little draw,
then from the top of a low divide we&rsquo;d see the
mine buildings. Come on, Jack,&rdquo; he ended, addressing
the foremost burro, which patiently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
turned after him as he led the way through the
trees.</p>
<p>They came to the draw, which proved shallow,
climbed the opposite bank, and gave an exclamation
of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Moses! They had some buildings and
plant there, eh, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other, as if remembering all that was represented
in the scene below, did not answer. He
was thinking of the days when his father and he
had been friendly, and of how that restless,
grasping, conquering dreamer had built many
hopes, even as he squandered many dollars, on
the Croix d&rsquo;Or. It was to produce millions. It
was to be one of the greatest gold mines in the
world. All that it required was more development.
Now, it was to have a huge mill to handle
vast quantities of low-grade ore; then all it
needed was cheaper power, so it must have electric
equipment. Again the milling results were
not good, and what it demanded was the cyanide
process.</p>
<p>And so it had been, for years that he could
still remember, and always it led his father on
and on, deferring or promising hope, to come,
at last, to this! A great, idle plant with some
of its buildings falling into decay, its roadways
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
obliterated by the brush growth that was creeping
back through the clearings as Nature reconquered
her own, and its huge waste dumps losing
their ugliness under the green moss.</p>
<p>It seemed useless to think of anything more
than an occasional pay chute. Yet, as he thought
of it, hope revived; for there had been pay
chutes of marvelous wealth. Why, men still
talked of the Bonanza Chute that yielded eighty
thousand dollars in four days&rsquo; blasting before it
worked out! Maybe there were others, but that
was what his father and Sloan had always expected,
and never found!</p>
<p>His meditations were cut short by a shout from
below. A man appeared, small in the distance,
on the flat, or &ldquo;yard&rdquo; of what seemed to be the
blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who that can be?&rdquo; speculated Bill,
drawing his hat rim farther over his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Townsend, puzzled.
&ldquo;I never heard of their having any watchmen
here. But we&rsquo;ll soon find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started down the hillside at a faster pace,
the tired animals surmising, with their curiously
acute instinct, that this must be the end of the
journey and hastening to have it over with. As
they broke through a screen of brush and came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
out to the edge of what had been a clearing back
of a huge log bunk-house, the man who had
shouted came rapidly forward to meet them.
There was a certain shiftless, sullen, yet authoritative
air about him as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you fellers want here?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you know that no one&rsquo;s allowed on the
Cross ground, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; replied Townsend,
inclined to be pacific, &ldquo;but I fancy, we are different
from almost any one else that would
come. We represent the owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; came the blustering
answer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to hit the trail. I don&rsquo;t
take orders from no one but Presby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shade of annoyance was depicted on Townsend&rsquo;s
face as he continued to ignore the watchman&rsquo;s
arrogance, and asked: &ldquo;And please tell
us, who is Presby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presby? Who&rsquo;s Presby? What are you
handin&rsquo; me? You don&rsquo;t know Presby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked you,&rdquo;
Townsend answered with less patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; drawled his companion, with a calm
deliberation that would have been dreaded by
those who knew him, &ldquo;does it hurt you much to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
be civil? You were asked who this man Presby
is. Do you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman glared at him for a moment,
but there was something in the cold eyes and firm
lines of the prospector&rsquo;s face that caused him to
hesitate before venturing any further display of
officiousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the owner of the Rattler,&rdquo; he answered
sullenly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got orders from him that nobody,
not any one, is to step a foot on this
ground. If you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; come by the road, you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo;
seen the sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners looked at each other for an instant,
and the younger man, ignoring the elder&rsquo;s
apparent wrath, said: &ldquo;Well, I suppose the best
thing we can do is to leave the burros here and
go and see Presby, and get this man of his called
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll leave no burros here!&rdquo; asserted the
watchman, recovering his combativeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you fool,&rdquo; exploded Mathews, starting
toward him with his fists clenched and anger
blazing from his eyes at the watchman&rsquo;s obstinate
stupidity, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re talking to one of the owners
of this mine! This is Mr. Townsend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant the man appeared abashed, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
then grumbled acridly: &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t help it.
I&rsquo;ve got orders and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, Bill,&rdquo; interrupted the owner,
stepping to the nearest burro&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go on over to Presby, and get rid of this man of
his. It won&rsquo;t hurt the burros to go a little
farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the watchman, who was scowling
and obdurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can Presby and the Rattler be
found?&rdquo; he asked crisply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around the turn down at the mouth of the
ca&ntilde;on,&rdquo; the watchman mumbled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not more
than half or three-quarters of a mile from here,
but you&rsquo;d better go back up the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if this last suggestion was the breaking
straw, the big prospector jumped forward, and
caught the man&rsquo;s wrist with dexterous, sinewy
fingers. He gave the arm a jerk that almost took
the man from his feet. His eyes were hard and
sharp now, and his jaw seemed to have shut
tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back up no hill, you bet on that!&rdquo;
he asserted belligerently. &ldquo;We go by the road.
We&rsquo;re done foolin&rsquo; with you, my bucko! You go
ahead and show the way and be quick about it!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll have trouble with me. Now
git!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He released the wrist with a shove that sent
the watchman ten feet away, and cowed him to
subjection. He recovered his balance, and hesitated
for a minute, muttering something about
&ldquo;being even for that,&rdquo; and then, as the big, infuriated
miner took a step toward him, said: &ldquo;All
right! Come on,&rdquo; and started toward a roadway
that, half ruined, led off and was lost at a
turn. Cursing softly and telling the burros that
it was a shame they had to go farther on account
of a fool, the prospector followed, and the little
procession resumed its straggling march.</p>
<p>They passed the huge bunk-house, a mess-house,
an assay office, what seemed to be the superintendent&rsquo;s
quarters, and a dozen smaller
structures, all of logs, and began an abrupt descent.
The top of the ca&ntilde;on was so high that
they looked down on the roof of the big, silent
stamp mill with its quarter of a mile of covered
tramway stretching like a huge, weather-beaten
snake to the dumps of the grizzly and breakers
behind it.</p>
<p>The road was blasted from the side of the
ca&ntilde;on on which they were, and far below, between
them and the hoisting house and the mill,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
ran a clear little mountain stream, undefiled for
years by the silt of industry. The peak of the
cross, lifting a needle point high above them, as
if keeping watch over the Blue Mountains, the
far-distant Idaho hills, the near-by forests of
Oregon, and the puny, man-made structures at
its feet, appeared to have a lofty disdain of them
and the burrowings into its mammoth sides, as if
all ravagers were mere parasites, mad to uncover
its secrets of gold, and futile, if successful, to
wreak the slightest damage on its aged heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AN UGLY WATCHMAN</h3>
</div>
<p>By easy stages indicating competent engineering
and a lavish expenditure of
money, the road led them downward to a
barricade of logs, in an opening of which swung
a gate barely wide enough to pass the tired burros
and their packs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find Presby over there,&rdquo; said their
unwilling guide, pointing at a group of red-painted
mining structures nestled in a flat lap in
the ragged mountains.</p>
<p>They surmised that this must be the Rattler
camp, and inspected its display of tall smokestacks,
high hoists, skeleton tramways, and bleak
dumps. Before they could make any reply, the
gate behind them slammed shut with a vicious
bang that attracted their attention. They turned
to see the watchman hurrying back up the road.
Fixed to the barricade was a sign, crudely lettered,
but insistently distinct:</p>
<p>No one allowed on these premises, by order of
the owners. For any business to be transacted
with the Croix d&rsquo;Or, apply to Thomas W. Presby.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Curt enough, at least, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; commented
Townsend, half-smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curt!&rdquo; growled his companion, frowning,
with his recent anger but half-dissipated. &ldquo;Curt
as a bulldog takin&rsquo; a bite out of your leg. Don&rsquo;t
waste no time at all on words. Just says: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
you I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; after.&rsquo; Where do you reckon
we&rsquo;ll find this here Thomas Presby person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he must have an office up there
somewhere,&rdquo; answered Townsend, waving his
arm in the direction of the scattered buildings
spread in that profligacy of space which comes
where space is free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These mules is tired. It&rsquo;s a shame we
couldn&rsquo;t have left them up there,&rdquo; Mathews
answered, looking at them and fondling the ears
of the nearest one. &ldquo;You go on up and get an
order letting us into your mine, and I&rsquo;ll wait here.
No use in makin&rsquo; these poor devils do any more&rsquo;n
they have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Townsend assented, and followed a path
which zigzaged around bowlders and stumps up
to the red cluster on the hillside above him. He
was impatient and annoyed at the useless delays
imposed upon them in this new venture, and
wondered why his father&rsquo;s partner had not informed
him of the fact that he would find the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
mine guarded by the owner of the adjoining property.</p>
<p>A camp &ldquo;washwoman,&rdquo; with clothespins in
her mouth, and a soggy gray shirt in her hands,
paused to stare at him from beneath a row of
other gray and blue shirts and coarse underwear,
dripping from the lines above her head.</p>
<p>Two little boys, fantastically garbed in faded
blue denim which had evidently been refashioned
from cast-off wearing apparel of their sires, followed
after him, hand in hand, as if the advent
of a stranger on the Rattler grounds was an event
of interest, and he found himself facing a squat,
red, white-bordered, one-storied building, over
whose door a white-and-black sign told the stranger,
or applicant for work, that he was at the
&ldquo;office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man came to a window in a picketed wicket
as he entered, and said briskly: &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see Mr. Presby,&rdquo; Dick answered,
wasting no more words than had the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if nobody else will do, go in through
that door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he had finished his speech, the bookkeeper
had turned again toward the ledgers
spread out on an unpainted, standing desk against
the wall behind his palings, and Dick walked to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
the only door in sight. He opened it, and stepped
inside. A white-headed, scowling man, clean
shaven, and with close-shut, thin, hard lips,
looked up over a pile of letters and accounts
laid before him on a cheap, flat-topped desk.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s eyes opened a trifle wider. He was
looking at the man who had defied the mob at
the road house, and at this close range studied
his appearance more keenly.</p>
<p>There was hard, insolent mastery in his every
line. His face had the sternness of granite. His
hands, poised when interrupted in their task, were
firm and wrinkled as if by years of reaching; and
his heavy body, short neck, and muscle-bent
shoulders, all suggested the man who had relentlessly
fought his way to whatever position of
dominancy he might then occupy. He wore the
same faded black hat planted squarely on his
head, and was in his shirt-sleeves. The only sign
of self-indulgence betrayed in him or his surroundings
was an old crucible, serving as an ash
tray, which was half-filled with cigar stumps, and
Dick observed, in that instant&rsquo;s swift appraisement,
that even these were chewed as if between
the teeth of a mentally restless man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to see me?&rdquo; the man questioned,
and then, as if the thin partition had not muffled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the words of the outer office, went on: &ldquo;You
asked for Presby. I&rsquo;m Presby. What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant, self-reliant and cool as he was,
Dick was confused by the directness of his greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to have you tell that watchman
over at the Croix d&rsquo;Or that we are to be admitted
there,&rdquo; he replied, forgetting that he had
not introduced himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should, eh? And who are you, may I
ask?&rdquo; came the dry, satirical response.</p>
<p>Dick flushed a trifle, feeling that he had begun
lamely in this reception and request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Richard Townsend,&rdquo; he answered, recovering
himself. &ldquo;A son of Charles Townsend,
and a half-owner in the property. I&rsquo;ve come to
look the Croix d&rsquo;Or over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not conscious of it then, but remembered
afterward, that Presby was momentarily
startled by the announcement. The man&rsquo;s eyes
seemed intent on penetrating and appraising him,
as he stood there without a seat having been proffered,
or any courtesy shown. Then, as if thinking,
Presby stared at the inkwell before him, and
frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I to know that?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Cross has had enough men wanting to look it
over to make an army. Maybe you&rsquo;re one of
them. Got any letters telling me that I&rsquo;m to
turn it over to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Dick was staggered by this
obstacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said reluctantly, &ldquo;I have not; that
is, nothing directed to you. I did not know that
you were in charge of the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was surprised to notice that Presby&rsquo;s heavy
brows adjusted themselves to a scowl. He wondered
why the mine owner should be antagonistic
to him, when there was nothing at stake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am,&rdquo; asserted Presby. &ldquo;I hired the
watchman up there, and I see to it that all the
stuff lying around loose isn&rsquo;t stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On whose authority, may I ask?&rdquo; questioned
Dick, without thought of giving offense, but
rather as a means of explaining his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sloan&rsquo;s. Why, you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m watching
it because I want it, do you, young man? The
old watchman threw up his job. I had Sloan&rsquo;s
address, and wrote him about it. Sloan wrote
and asked me to get a man to look after it, and
I did. Now, you show me that you&rsquo;ve got a
right to go on the grounds of the Cross Mine,
and I&rsquo;ll give an order to the watchman.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>There was absolute antagonism in his tone,
although not in his words. Dick thought of nothing
at the moment but that he had one sole proof
of his ownership, the letter from Sloan himself.
He unbuttoned the flap of his shirt pocket, and,
taking out a bundle of letters, selected the one
bearing on the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should be sufficient,&rdquo; he said, throwing
it, opened, before Presby.</p>
<p>The latter, without moving his solid body in
the least, and as if his arms and hands were
entirely independent of it, stolidly picked up the
letter and read it. Dick could infer nothing of
its reception. He could not tell whether Presby
was inclined to accept it as sufficient authority, or
to question it. Outside were the sounds of the
Rattler&rsquo;s activity and production, the heavy,
thunderous roar of the stamp mill, the clash of
cars of ore dumped into the maws of the grizzly
to be hammered into smaller fragments in their
journey to the crusher, and thence downward to
end their journeys over the thumping stamps, and
out, disintegrated, across the wet and shaking
tables.</p>
<p>It seemed, as he stood waiting, that the dust
of the pulverized mountains had settled over
everything in the office save the granite-like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
figure that sat at the desk, rereading the letter
which had changed all his life. For the first time
he thought that perhaps he should not have so
easily displayed that link with his past. It seemed
a useless sacrilege. If the mine-owner was not
reading the letter, he was pondering, unmoved,
over a course of action, and took his time.</p>
<p>Dick thought bitterly, in a flash, of all that it
represented. The quarrel with his father on that
day he had returned from Columbia University
with a mining course proudly finished, when each,
stubborn by nature, had insisted that his plan was
the better; of his rebellious refusal to enter the
brokerage office in Wall Street, and declaration
that he intended to go into the far West and follow
his profession, and of the stern old man&rsquo;s
dismissal when he asserted, with heat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always taken the road you wanted
to go since your mother died. I objected to your
taking up mining engineering, but you went ahead
in spite of me. I tried to get you to take an interest
in the business that has been my life work,
but you scorned it. You wouldn&rsquo;t be a broker,
or a banker. You had to be a mining engineer!
All right, you&rsquo;ve had your way, so far. Now,
you can keep on in the way you have selected. I&rsquo;ll
give you five thousand dollars, but you&rsquo;ll never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
get another cent from me until you&rsquo;ve learned
what a fool you&rsquo;re making of yourself, and return
to do what I want you to do. It won&rsquo;t be
long! There&rsquo;s a vast difference between dawdling
around a university learning something that
is going to be useless while your father pays the
bills, and turning that foolish education into dollars
to stave off an empty belly. You can go
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those days the house of Phillip Townsend
had been a great name in New York. Now this
was all that was left of it. Dissolution, death,
and dust, and a half-interest in an abandoned
mine! The harsh voice of Bully Presby aroused
him from his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;This seems sufficient,
but if you&rsquo;ve got the sense and judgment Sloan
seems to think you have, you&rsquo;ll come to the conclusion
that there&rsquo;s not much use in wasting any
of his good, hard dollars on the Croix d&rsquo;Or. It
never has paid. It never will pay. I offered to
buy it once, but I wouldn&rsquo;t give a dollar for it
now, beyond what the timber above ground is
worth. It owns a full section of timberland, and
that&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached for a pen and wrote a note to the
watchman, telling him that the bearer, Richard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
Townsend, had come to look over the property
and that his orders must be accepted, and signed
it with his hard-driven scrawl. He handed it
up to Dick without rising from his seat, and said:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll fix you up, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if by an afterthought, he asked: &ldquo;Have
you any idea of the condition of the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dick answered, as he folded the letter
and put it into his pocket, together with the one
from his late father&rsquo;s partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I can tell you, it&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; said
Presby, fixing him with his cool, hard stare.
&ldquo;The Cross is spotted. Once in a while they
had pay chutes. They never had a true ledge.
There isn&rsquo;t one there, as far as anybody that ever
worked it knows. They wasted five hundred
thousand dollars trying to find it, and drove ten
thousand feet of drifts and tunnels. They went
down more than six hundred feet. She&rsquo;s under
water, no one knows how deep. It might take
twenty thousand to un-water the sinking shaft
again, and at the bottom you&rsquo;d find nothing.
Take my advice. Let it alone. Good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick walked out, scarcely knowing whether
to feel grateful for the churlish advice or to resume
his wonted attitude of self-reliance and hold
himself unprejudiced by Presby&rsquo;s condemnation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
of the Croix d&rsquo;Or. He wondered if Bully
Presby suspected him of having been friendly
with the mob of drunken ruffians at the road
house, but he had been given no chance to
explain.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the gulch he found Bill
sprawled at length on his elbows almost under
the forefeet of one of the burros which was nosing
him over in a friendly caress. He called out
as he approached, and the big prospector sat
up, deftly snapped the cigarette he had been
smoking into the creek with his thumb and forefinger,
and got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we get permission to go on the claim?&rdquo;
he grinned, as Townsend reached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got an order to the watchman. The
old man doesn&rsquo;t seem to think much of it. Says
it&rsquo;s spotted. Had rich pay chutes, but they
pinched. No regular formation. Always been
a loser. Thinks we&rsquo;d be foolish to do anything
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good of him, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked quickly at the hard, lined face of
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first thing I&rsquo;ve heard that made
me feel better,&rdquo; declared the prospector, as he
swung one of the burro&rsquo;s heads back into the trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
and hit the beast a friendly slap on the haunches
to start it forward. &ldquo;Whenever a man, like this
old feller seems to be, gives me that kind of
advice, I sit up and take notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;why, what do you know about him?&rdquo;
Dick asked, falling into the trail behind the pack
animals, which had started forward with their
slow jog trot, and ears swaying backward and
forward as they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you was gone,&rdquo; Mathews answered,
&ldquo;I had a long talk with a boy that came along
and got friendly. You can believe boys, most
of &rsquo;em. They know a heap more than men.
They think out things that men don&rsquo;t. Kids
are always friends with me; you know that. I
reckon, from what I gathered, that this Presby
man is about as hard and grasping an old cuss
as ever worked the last ounce of gold out of
a waste dump. He makes the men save the fags
of the candles and the drips, so&rsquo;s he can melt
&rsquo;em over again. He runs a company store, and
if they don&rsquo;t buy boots and grub from him, they
have to tear out mighty quick. He fired a fireman
because the safety-valve in the boiler-house
let go one day twenty minutes before the noon
shift went back to work. If he says, &lsquo;Let the
Cross alone,&rsquo; I think it&rsquo;s because he wants it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t guess who he is,&rdquo; Dick said,
preparing to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Do I know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way. He&rsquo;s the man we saw the mob
tackle, back there at the road house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill gave a long whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the chap, eh? Bully Presby! Well,
if we ever run foul of him, we&rsquo;ve got our work
cut out for us. Things are beginnin&rsquo; to get interestin&rsquo;.
&lsquo;I like the place,&rsquo; as Daniel said when
he went to sleep in the lion&rsquo;s den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They opened the gate through the barricade
without any formality, and were well started up
the inclined road of the Croix d&rsquo;Or before they
encountered the watchman who had given them
so much trouble. As he came toward them,
frowning, they observed that he had buckled a
pistol round him as if to resist any intrusion in
case it should be attempted without instructions.
Dick handed him Presby&rsquo;s order, and the man
read it through in surly silence; then his entire
attitude underwent a swift change. He became
almost obsequiously respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go down and have a talk with
Mr. Presby,&rdquo; he said, and would have ventured
a further remark, but was cut short by the mine-owner.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;d better go and see him,&rdquo; Dick said
concisely. &ldquo;And when you go, take all of your
dunnage you can carry, then come back and get
the rest. I shall not want you on the claim an
hour longer than necessary for you to get your
stuff away. You&rsquo;re too good a man to have
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow gave a shrug of his shoulders, an
evil grin, and turned back up the road to vanish
in what had evidently been the superintendent&rsquo;s
cabin, and noisily began to whistle as he gathered
his stuff together. The partners halted before
the door, and Dick looked inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have the keys for everything,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>The man impudently tossed a bundle at him
without a word. Apparently his belongings were
but few, which led the newcomers to believe that
he had taken his meals at the Rattler, and perhaps
slept there on many nights. They watched
him as he rolled his blankets, and prepared to
start down the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of that plunder in there, the pots
and the lamp, belong to the mine,&rdquo; he said. And
then, without other words, turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be the last of him, and maybe it
won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; growled Bill, as he began throwing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
hitches off the tired burros that stood panting outside
the door. &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s the fag end of
him to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were amazed at the lavish expenditure
of money that had been made in the superintendent&rsquo;s
quarters. There were a porcelain bathtub
brought up into the heart of the wilderness,
a mahogany desk whose edges had been burned
by careless smokers, and a safe whose door
swung open, exposing a litter of papers, mine
drawings, and plans. The four rooms evidently
included office and living quarters, and they betokened
a reckless financial outlay for the purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Dad!&rdquo; said Dick, looking around him.
&ldquo;No wonder the Cross lost money if this is a
sample of the way the management spent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped outside to where the ca&ntilde;on was
beginning to sink into the dusk. The early moon,
still behind the silhouette of the eastern fringe of
peaks and forests, lighted up the yellow cross
mark high above, and for some reason, in the
stillness of the evening, he accepted it as a sign
of promise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE BLACK DEATH</h3>
</div>
<p>It took seven days of exploration to reveal the
condition of the Cross of Gold, and each
night the task appeared more hopeless.
The steel pipe line, leading down for three miles
of sinuous, black length, from a reservoir high up
in the hills, had been broken here and there
maliciously by some one who had traversed its
length and with a heavy pick driven holes into it
that inflicted thousands of dollars of expense.</p>
<p>The Pelton wheels in the power house, neglected,
were rusted in their bearings, and without
them and the pipe line there could be no electric
power on which the mill depended. The mill
had been stripped of all smaller stuff, and its
dynamos had been chipped with an ax until the
copper windings showed frayed and useless. The
shoes of the huge stamps were worn down to a
thin, uneven rim, battering on broken surfaces.
The Venners rattled on their foundations, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
the plates had been scarred as if by a chisel in
the hands of a maniac.</p>
<p>The blacksmith&rsquo;s tunnel&ndash;&ndash;the tunnel leading
off from the level&ndash;&ndash;was blocked by fallen timbers
where a belt of lime formation cut across;
and fragments of wood, splintered into toothpick
size, had been thrown out when the mountain
settled to its place. But a short distance from
the main shaft, which was a double compartment,
carrying two cages up and down, in every level
the air was foul down to the five-hundred foot,
and below that the mine was filled with water.</p>
<p>Patiently Dick and the veteran explored these
windings as far as they might until the guttering
of their candles warned them that the air was
loaded with poison, and often they retreated
none too soon to scale the slippery, yielding rungs
of the ladder with dizzy heads. Expert and experienced,
they were puzzled by what was disclosed.
Either the mine had yielded exceedingly
rich streaks and had been, in mining parlance,
&ldquo;gophered,&rdquo; or else the management had been
as foolish as ever handled a property.</p>
<p>In the assay-house, where the furnaces were
dust-covered, the scale case black with grime, and
the floor littered with refuse crucibles, cupels,
mufflers, and worn buckboards, they discovered a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
bundle of old tablets. Almost invariably these
showed that the assays had been made from samples
that would have paid to work, but this alone
gave them no hope.</p>
<p>But this was not all. A mysterious enmity
seemed to pursue all their efforts. Yet its displays
were unaccountable for by natural causes.
On their arrival at the mine they found water,
fresh and clear, piped into every cabin, the mess-house,
and the superintendent&rsquo;s quarters. They
traced it back and discovered a small lake formed
and fed by a large spring on what was evidently
land of the mine. It suddenly failed them, and
proved unwholesome. An investigation of the
tiny reservoir disclosed masses of poisonous
weeds in the water. They decided that they
must have been blown there after their arrival,
cleared the supply and yet, but two days later,
when there had been no wind of more than noticeable
violence, the weeds were there again. They
abandoned their water supply for the time being
and resorted to the stream at the bottom of the
ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>A day later one of their burros died mysteriously,
and Bill, puzzled, said he believed that it
had lost its sense of smell and eaten something
poisonous. On the day following the other died,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
apparently from the same complaint. The veteran
miner grieved over them as for friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been acquainted with a good many of
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said, sorrowfully, &ldquo;but I never knew
two that had finer characters than these two did.
They were regular burros! No cheaters&ndash;&ndash;just
the square, open and above-board kind, that never
kicked without layin&rsquo; back their ears to give you
warnin&rsquo; and never laid down on the trail unless
they wanted to rest. The meanest thing a burro
or a man can do is to die voluntarily when you&rsquo;re
dependin&rsquo; on him, or when he owes you work or
money. So it does seem as if I must have been
mistaken in these two, after all, because we may
need &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick did not smile at his homily, for he caught
the significance of it, that the Croix d&rsquo;Or would
have to make a better showing than they had so
far discovered to warrant them in opening it.
They had come almost to the end of the investigations
possible. They scanned plans and scales
in the office to familiarize themselves with the
property, and there was but one portion of it they
had not visited. That was a shaft which had
been the &ldquo;discovery hole,&rdquo; where the first find of
ore had been made. And it was this they entered
on the day when Fate seemed most particularly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
unkind. Yet even Fate appeared to relent, in the
end, through one of those trifling afterthoughts
which lead men to do the insignificant act. They
had prepared everything for the venture. They
had an extra supply of candles, chalk for making
a course mark, sample bags for such pieces of ore
as might interest them, and the prospectors&rsquo; picks
and hammers when they started out. They were
a hundred yards from the office when the younger
man hesitated, stopped and turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea we might need those old maps,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t gone over them very
much and they might come in handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill protested, but despite this Dick went back
to the quarters and got them. They were crude,
apparently, compared with the later work when
competent engineers had opened the mine in
earnest; but doubtless had served their purpose.
The men came to the mouth of the old shaft
which had been loosely covered over with poles,
and around which a thicket of wild blackberry
bushes had sprung up in stunted growth. An
hour&rsquo;s work disclosed the black opening and a
ladder in a fair state of preservation. They lowered
a candle into the depths and saw that it
burned undimmed, indicating that the air was
pure, and then descended cautiously, testing each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
rung as they went. The shaft was not more
than fifty feet deep, and they found themselves
standing on the bottom and peering off into a
drift which had been crudely timbered and had
fallen in here and there as the unworked ground
had settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much of anything
here except some starved quartz,&rdquo; Bill said,
staring at the wall after they had gone in some
thirty or forty feet, and they had come to a place
where the lagging had dropped away. He caught
another piece of the half-rotted timbering and
jerked it loose for a better inspection. It gave
with a dull crack, then, immediately after, and
seeming almost an echo, there was a terrific
rumble, and a report like the explosion of a huge
gun back in the direction of the shaft. Their
candles flickered in the air impact, and for an
instant they feared that the roof was coming
down on them to crush them out of all resemblance
to human beings.</p>
<p>They turned and ran toward the shaft. A few
loose pebbles and pieces of rock were dripping
from above like a shower of porphyry. For an
instant they dared not step out, but stood inside
the drift, waiting for what might happen and
staring at each other with set faces exposed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
the still flickering light. They had said nothing
up to this time, being under too great stress to
offer other than sharp exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like that shaft had given way!&rdquo; the
veteran exclaimed. &ldquo;If it has&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward and looked into Dick&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it has,&rdquo; the latter took up, &ldquo;we are in a
bad predicament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood tensed and anxious until the pebbles
stopped falling and a silence like that of a
tomb, so profound as to seem thick and dense,
invaded the hollows; then Dick started out into
the shaft. He felt a restraining hand on his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, boy,&rdquo; the elder man said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the owner here. It&rsquo;s dangerous. I
ought to be the one to go first and find out what&rsquo;s
happened. You wait inside the drift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dick shook his hand off and stepped out
to look upward. A dense blackness filled what
should have been a space of light. This he had
partially expected from the fact that when they
came out toward the shaft there had been no
sign of day; but he had not anticipated such
a complete closing of the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! We&rsquo;re buried in!&rdquo; came an exclamation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
from behind him, and he felt a sudden
sinking of the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go easily till I come to it,&rdquo; he said, his
voice sounding strained and loud although he had
spoken scarcely above a whisper. &ldquo;You stand
clear so that if anything gives, Bill, you won&rsquo;t be
caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder miner would have protested, but
already he was slowly and cautiously climbing
the ladder. Step by step he ascended, holding
the light above his head to discover the place
where the shaft had given way, and then Bill,
standing anxiously below, heard a harsh shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the ladder will bear your weight as
well as mine. Come up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man climbed steadily upward until he
stood directly beneath the younger man&rsquo;s feet.
He ventured an exclamation that was almost an
oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the shaft at all,&rdquo; he said, an instant
later. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a bowlder so big that it filled the
whole opening. We&rsquo;re plugged and penned in
here like rats in a trap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick took his little prospecting hammer and
tapped the bowlder, at first gently, then with
firmer strokes, and looked down at his partner
with a distressed face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that?&rdquo; he exclaimed, rather than questioned.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big one, and solid. It sounds
bad to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute they waved their candles round
the edge, inspecting the resting place of the rock
that had imprisoned them. Everywhere it was
set firmly. A fitted door could have been no more
secure. They consulted, and at last Bill descended
and stepped back into the entrance to the drift to
avoid falling stone, while the younger man attacked
the edge beneath the bowlder, inch by inch,
trying to find some place where he could pick
through to daylight. At last, his arm wearied
and the point of his prospecting hammer dulled,
he rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, Dick, and I&rsquo;ll take a spell,&rdquo;
Bill called up from below, and he obeyed.</p>
<p>The big miner, without comment, climbed up,
and again the vault-like space was filled with the
persistent picking of steel on stone. For a half-hour
it continued, and then, slowly, Bill descended.
He sat down at the foot of the shaft,
wiped the sweat from his face, thrust his candlestick
in a crevice and rolled a cigarette before he
said anything, and then only as Dick started to
the foot of the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re holed up all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
right. I picked clear around the lower edge and
there isn&rsquo;t a place where she isn&rsquo;t resting on solid
rock. Nothing but dynamite could ever move
that stone. Unless we can find some other way
out we&rsquo;re&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and Dick added the finishing word,
&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! No one knows we&rsquo;re here. No
one comes to the mine. We&rsquo;re in the old works
which I don&rsquo;t suppose a man has been inside of
in five or ten years, and the map shows that it
doesn&rsquo;t connect with the other ones. Answer&ndash;&ndash;the
finish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick pulled the worn and badly drawn plans
from his pocket and then lighted his own candle,
indulging in the extravagance of two that he
might study the faint and smudged penciled lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Bill,&rdquo; he said, pointing at the drawing.
&ldquo;These two side drifts each end in what are now
sump holes. We&rsquo;ve got to watch out for them.
That makes it safe for us to take the main drift
and see where it leads. The two end drifts evidently
ran but a few feet and were then abandoned.
So, if these plans are any good, they, too,
are safe, if we can get into them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder miner peered at the plans and studied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
them. He stood up and blew out his candle.
He thrust his hands into his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got three candles left,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I
cain&rsquo;t just exactly say why I put that many in
unless the Lord gave me a hunch we&rsquo;d need &rsquo;em.
How many you got!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One in my pocket, and this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better move fast, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took a desperate chance on foul air and
plunged down the drift, pausing only now and
then when they came to the first side drifts to
make sure of their course. They were informed
by the plans that they had barely three hundred
feet to explore, yet they had gone even farther
than that before they came to a halt, a threatening
one, for directly ahead of them the timbering
had given way, the shaft caved, and there seemed
at first no opening through the d&eacute;bris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this looks pretty tough!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bill, stooping down and examining the face of
the barrier.</p>
<p>His companion lighted his own candle and together
they went over the face of the obstruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if we could open her up a
little if we can shift this timber here and use
it as a lever,&rdquo; he said, pointing to one projecting
near the roof.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;May bring the whole mountain down, but
it&rsquo;s our only chance,&rdquo; agreed Bill. &ldquo;Here she
goes. Stand back. No use in both of us getting
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught the end of the timber in his heavy
hands, planted his feet firmly on the floor and
heaved. The big timber creaked, but did not
give. Again he planted himself and this time
his great shoulders seemed to twist and writhe
until the muscles cracked and then, with a crash,
the barrier gave way. He sprang back with
amazing quickness and they ran back up the drift
for twenty or thirty feet while the mass again
readjusted itself and settled slowly into position.
A cloud of dust bellowed toward them, half-choking
them with its gritty fineness, and then, in a
minute, the air had cleared. They went cautiously
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we got some farther, anyhow, unless
she comes down while we&rsquo;re working through.
We&rsquo;ve got a hole to crawl into, and that&rsquo;s something,&rdquo;
the big miner asserted.</p>
<p>Before he could say anything more Dick
had crowded him to one side and was entering
the aperture. He had prevented his partner from
taking the first perilous chance. Painfully he
made his way, while the man behind listened with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
terrified apprehension; for none knew better than
he the risk of that progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but be careful,&rdquo; a voice came to
him faintly from the distance. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bad, but
the air over here seems good. It&rsquo;s a close
shave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big miner dropped down and began crawling
through beneath the tons of balanced rock,
which might give at any instant. Larger than
his younger companion, he found it more difficult
for his great shoulders persisted in brushing at
all times, and now and then he was compelled
to squeeze himself through a narrow place that
for a moment threatened to be impossible. Once
a timber above him gave a little and a rock
crowded down until only by exerting his whole
force could he sustain it while he scraped his
hips through from under it. Then as it descended
between his legs he found one of them
pinioned. He shut his teeth desperately to avoid
shouting, and twisted sidewise, and back, to and
fro, at the imminent danger of dislodging everything
above him. He heard an anxious voice
calling outside and replied that he was coming
and was all right. He rested for an instant to
regain breath, then made a desperate forward
effort to find that his foot alone caught him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Again he rolled from side to side, and again
he rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill! Bill! For God&rsquo;s sake, what has happened?&rdquo;
he heard an agonized call from ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, boy,&rdquo; he called back patiently.
&ldquo;Just keep away from the hole so I can get air.
I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m just findin&rsquo; some places a little tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His reply did not seem to allay the solicitude
of his companion, who called again, &ldquo;Can I help
you in any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only by keeping clear. I&rsquo;ll make another
try. Stand clear so if she comes down you won&rsquo;t
be caught. If she does come&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;good-bye,
Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the final word he made another
fiercely desperate effort from his new position.
There was a ripping, searing pain along the
length of his foot which he disregarded in that
supreme attempt and suddenly he seemed to slide
forward while back of him came a crunching,
grinding noise as the disturbed rock which had
pinioned him settled down into place. He
crawled desperately forward. A light flared in
his eyes and he felt strong hands thrust under
his arm pits and was jerked bodily out to the floor
of the drift. They fell together and the candle,
falling with them, was extinguished. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
overwhelmed, as they lay there in the darkness,
gasping, by a terrific crashing impact as if the
whole mountain had given way and at their very
feet huge rocks thundered down. They crawled
farther along on hands and knees and the falling
rock seemed to pursue them malignantly. For
an age it seemed as if the whole drift would give
way as each set of timbers came to the strain and
failed to hold. Then again all was still.</p>
<p>Strangling, sweating, spent, they got to the side
wall and raised themselves up, gasping for fresh
air. Their senses wavered and swooned in that
half-suffocation and slowly they comprehended
that they were still alive and that the dust was
settling. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; they called to each
other in acute unison, their voices betraying a
great apprehension, and then, reassured for the
instant, they sagged weakly against the walls and
each reached out to find the other. Their hands
met and clasped fervently and, again in unison,
they said, &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A match spluttered dimly through the dark and
dust-clogged air, a candle slowly took flame and
they looked at each other. Bill was leaning
against the wall, weakly, and trying to recover
his strength. A tattered trousers leg clung above
his bared leg and foot where he had wrenched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
himself loose from the rock, and torn his boot
away in so doing. Along the length of the white
flesh was a flaring line of red, where the point
of rock had cut deeply when he made that last
desperate struggle to escape. He dropped to
the floor and clutched his wound with his hands
while Dick, almost with a moan, thrust his candlestick
into a timber and savagely tore his shirt
off and rent it into strips. He stooped over and
with hasty skill bandaged the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad, I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it does
hurt, doesn&rsquo;t it, old partner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; bravely drawled the giant,
striving to force a grin to his pain-drawn lips.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry now, boy! Think what might
have happened if I&rsquo;d been there a minute or two
longer, or if I couldn&rsquo;t have got loose at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their thankfulness for the last escape they
had almost forgotten the fact that their situation
was still almost hopeless, and that perhaps the
speedy end would have been preferable to one
more agonizing, more slow, to come. They got
to their feet at last and hobbled forward, the
big man resting half his weight on his friend&rsquo;s
shoulder and making slow progress. Again they
were centered on the faint hope that beyond was
some sort of opening, because now they knew but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
too well that their retreat was effectually cut off.
If there was no opening ahead they were
doomed. They consulted the plan again and went
forward. Abruptly they came to a halt, shutting
their jaws hard. They had come to the end of
the main drift and it was a blank wall of solid
stone where the prospectors had finished!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old man, there&rsquo;s still the two side
drifts to examine,&rdquo; said Bill with a plain attempt
to appear hopeful that did not in the least deceive
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s back there about fifty feet,&rdquo;
Dick assented, finding that it required an effort
to steady his voice. &ldquo;The other one is behind
that barrier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other, reading the same
thought. They had but one more chance and that
was almost futile; for the plans indicated that
the side drift extended but a score or so of yards
and had then been abandoned. They felt their
feet faltering when they turned into it, dreading
the end, dreading the revelation that must tell
them they were to die in this limited burrow in
the hills. But courageously they tried to assume
an air of confidence. They did not speak as they
progressed, each dreading that instant when he
would again face an inexorable barrier. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
counted their steps as they went, to themselves.
They came to the twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second,
and were peering fixedly ahead. Together
they stopped and turned toward each
other. Dimly in the faintly thrown light of the
candle beams, they could see it, the dusky gray
mass where hope had pictured a continuing blackness.
The wall leered at them as they stood
there panting, despairing, desperate as trapped
animals. Their imaginations told them the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old man&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Bill&rsquo;s voice sounded with
exceptional softness&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t extend this
drift any farther. All we can do now is to go
up and sit down at the foot of it, and&ndash;&ndash;wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t take long, Bill,&rdquo; Dick replied.
&ldquo;The air, you know. It can&rsquo;t last forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They trudged forward for the few remaining
yards and then, abruptly, the candle they were
carrying gave a little flicker. This time they
stopped in their tracks and shouted. Bill suddenly
loosened his hold on the younger man&rsquo;s
shoulder and began hopping forward, and the
light threw huge, grotesque, strangely moving
shadows on the wall ahead of them. Dick ran
after him, crowding on his heels and shouting
meaningless hopes. Abruptly they came to a
right-angle drift, and then, but a few yards down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
it, they discovered an upraise, crude and uncared-for,
but climbing into the higher darkness, and
down this there streamed fresh air.</p>
<p>It was such a one as prospectors make, having
here and there a pole with cleats to serve as a
ladder, then ascending at an incline which, though
difficult, was not impossible, and again reverting
to rocky footholds at the sides. Up this Dick
boosted his partner, thrusting a shoulder beneath
his haunches and straining upward with the exultation
of reaction. They were saved! He knew
it! The fresh air told that story to their experienced
nostrils. Up, up, up they clambered
for a long slanting distance and then fell out on
the floor of another drift, at whose end was a
shadowy light. Again they hobbled down a long
length, ever approaching their goal. Bill stopped
and leaned against the side wall and voiced his
exultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where we are,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This
is the blacksmiths&rsquo; tunnel. They made that upraise
following the ore, and that&rsquo;s why the mine
was opened for the second time here. They
didn&rsquo;t complete the plans because they knew the
old work was useless. Dick, we&rsquo;ve been through
some pretty hard times together and had some
narrow shaves; but I don&rsquo;t care for many more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
like that! Come on. Help me out. I want you
to take a look and see if my head is any whiter
than it was at nine o&rsquo;clock this mornin&rsquo; when we
went into that other hole.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE AGED ENGINEER</h3>
</div>
<p>The sunlight was good to see again&ndash;&ndash;good
as only sunlight can be when men have
not expected ever again to be enlivened
by its glory. They were astonished at the shortness
of the time of their imprisonment. They had
lived years in dread thought, and but a few hours
in reality. They had suffered for the spans of
lives to find that the clock had imperturbably
registered brief intervals. They had played the
gamut of dread, terror, and anguish, to learn how
trivial, after all, was the completed score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that will do,&rdquo; said Dick, with a sigh
of relief, as he straightened up from bandaging
Bill&rsquo;s leg. &ldquo;The stitches probably hurt some,
but aside from a day&rsquo;s stiffness I don&rsquo;t think
you will ever know it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t eh?&rdquo; rumbled the patient. &ldquo;Sure,
the leg&rsquo;s all right; but it ain&rsquo;t bruised limbs a man
remembers. They heal. You can see the scars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
on a man&rsquo;s legs, but only the Lord Almighty can
see those on his mind, and they&rsquo;re the only ones
that last. Dick, now that it&rsquo;s all over, I ain&rsquo;t
ashamed to tell you that there was quite a long
spell down there underground when I thought
over a heap of things I might have done different
if I&rsquo;d had a chance to do &rsquo;em over again. And,
boy, I thought quite a little bit about you! It
didn&rsquo;t seem right that a young fellow like you,
with so much to live for, should be snuffed out
down there in that black place, where the whole
mountain acted as if it was chasin&rsquo; us, step by
step, to wipe us off the slate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood on his feet and limped across the
room to his coat in an effort to recover himself,
and Dick, more stirred than he cared to admit
by the affection in his voice, tramped out to the
little porch in front and pretended to whistle a
tune, that proved tuneless. He looked at the
little valley around the shoulder of the mountain
at the head of the ravine, which they had so carelessly
invaded that morning, and shuddered.
Inside he heard Bill moving around, and then
after a time his steps advancing stiffly, and turned
to see him coming out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said smiling, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;re
entitled to a rest for to-day. By to-morrow you&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
be all right again, unless I&rsquo;m mistaken. Let&rsquo;s put
in the day looking over these old records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill grinned whimsically and assented. He
could keep quiet when he had to; but the day
following found him again restlessly investigating
anything that seemed worth the trouble and
the afternoon saw him standing looking upward
toward the same valley of dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got over it a little,&rdquo; he said to the
younger man, &ldquo;and do you know I&rsquo;m right curious
to go over there and see how big that rock
was that tumbled into the mouth of the old shaft.
Want to come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had sustained that same curiosity, so
together they made their way to the beginning
of the previous day&rsquo;s disaster. They chilled
when they saw how effectually they had been
caught; for the bowlder completely filled the
entrance to the shaft and would have proved a
hopeless trap had they tried to escape by burrowing
around its edge. It rested, as they had discovered,
on solid rock, and its course down the
hillside was clearly marked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gets me,&rdquo; said the veteran miner, &ldquo;is
what could have started it. I noticed it up
there when we went in. It was sort of poised on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
that little ledge you see, and it didn&rsquo;t have to roll
more than thirty feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to climb up the bowlder&rsquo;s well-defined
path, and suddenly called to his partner
with a hoarse shout, needlessly loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That bowlder
never started itself! Some one helped it. What
do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick hastily climbed up to his side and looked.
The rock around was bare of growth or covering,
so that no footprints could be discerned; but
a rock rested there that had plainly been used as
a fulcrum. The surface beneath it was weather
beaten and devoid of moisture, which indicated
that it had lain there but a short time, probably
only from the time of its mission on the preceding
day. They found themselves standing up
and staring around at the surrounding hills as if
seeking sight of the man who had attempted to
murder them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out about this!&rdquo; Bill exclaimed.
&ldquo;Good thing we know enough to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He limped to the edge of the barren spot and
began to circle around its edge, while Dick did
likewise, following his example. They found a
footprint at last and took the trail. It did not
lead them far before they came to a path on top
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
of the hill that was so well used that any attempt
to follow it was useless; but, intent on seeing
where it led, they walked along it as it led straight
away toward the timber. Scarcely inside the cool
shadows of the tamaracks they paused and
looked at each other understandingly; for thrown
carelessly into a clump of laurel was a long,
freshly cut sapling, that had been used as a lever.
They recovered it from its resting place and
inspected it. There was no doubt whatever that
it had been the instrument of motion. Its
scarred end, its length, and all, told that the man
who had used it had carried it this far to discard
it, believing his murderous work done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that rock, as I said before,&rdquo;
declared Bill. &ldquo;You noticed how round it was
on one side? Well, a man could take this lever,
and by teetering on it until he got it in motion,
finally upset it. The chances were a hundred to
one it would land in the mouth of the shaft. And
it&rsquo;s a cinch, it seems to me, he wouldn&rsquo;t do that for
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who could it be?&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Who
is there that could want us out of the way badly
enough to murder us? No one here knows or
cares a continental about us! It seems incredible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
It must have been sheer carelessness of some restless
loafer who wanted to see the rock roll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet they knew that the theory was scarcely tenable.
They walked farther along the path and
found that it was one used by workmen, evidently,
leading at last down the steep mountain side and
across to the Rattler. They surmised that it
must be one made by the timber cutters for the
mine, and learned, in later months, that the surmise
was correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes one thing certain,&rdquo; Bill declared
that evening when, candidly discouraged, they sat
on the little porch in front of the office they had
made their home and discussed the day&rsquo;s findings.
&ldquo;And that is that until we get a force to work
here, if we ever do, it ain&rsquo;t a right healthy place
for us. Of course with a gang of men around
there wouldn&rsquo;t be a ghost of a chance for any
enemy to get us; but until then we&rsquo;d better watch
out all the time. I begin to believe that about
everything that&rsquo;s happened to us here has been
the work of somebody who ain&rsquo;t right fond of
us. Wish we could catch him at it once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a grim undercurrent in his wish
that left nothing to words. They remembered
that in all the time since their arrival they had
seen no other human being, the Rattler men having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
left them as severely alone as if they had been
under quarantine.</p>
<p>In the stillness of twilight they heard the slow,
soft padding of a man&rsquo;s feet laboriously climbing
the hill, and listened intently at the unusual sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who that is,&rdquo; speculated Bill, leaning
forward and staring at the dim trail.
&ldquo;Looks like a dwarf from here. Some old man
of the mountain coming up to drive us off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; hailed a shrill, quavering voice.
&ldquo;Be you the bosses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; Dick shouted, in reply, &ldquo;Come
on up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitor came halting up the slope, and they
discerned that he was lame and carrying a roll of
blankets. He paused before them, panting, and
then dropped the roll from his back, and sat
down on the edge of the porch with his head
turned to face them. He was white headed and
old, and seemed to have exhausted his surplus
strength in his haste to reach them before darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bells Park,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bells Park, the
engineer. Maybe you&rsquo;ve heard of me? Eh?
What? No? Well, I used to have the engines
here at the Cross eight or ten years ago, and
I&rsquo;ve come to take &rsquo;em again. When do I go to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
work? They hates me around here. They
drove me out once. I said I&rsquo;d come back. I&rsquo;m
here. I&rsquo;m a union man, but I tell &rsquo;em what I
think of &rsquo;em, and it don&rsquo;t set well. When did
you say I go to work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Dick answered
regretfully.</p>
<p>The Cross, so far as he could conjecture,
would never again ring with the sounds of throbbing
engines. Already he was more than half-convinced
that he should write to Sloan and reject
his kindly offer of support. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here
but a week, but it doesn&rsquo;t look promising to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then you&rsquo;re a pair of fools!&rdquo; came
the disrespectful and irascible retort. &ldquo;They
told me down in Goldpan that some miners had
come to open the Cross up again. You&rsquo;re not
miners. I&rsquo;ve hoofed it all the way up here for
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners looked at each other, and
grinned at the old man&rsquo;s tirade. He went on
without noticing them, speaking of himself in the
third person:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can stay here to-night somewhere, can&rsquo;t I?
Bells Park is askin&rsquo; it. Bells Park that used to
be chief in the Con and Virginia, and once had
his own cabin here&ndash;&ndash;cabin that was a home till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
his wife went away on the long trip. She&rsquo;s asleep
up there under the cross mark on the hill. Bells
Park as came back because he wanted to be near
where she was put away! She was the best
woman that ever lived. I&rsquo;m looking for my old
job back. I can sleep here, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His querulous question was more of a challenge
than a request, and Dick hastened to assure
him that he could unroll his blankets in a bunk
in the rambling old structure that loomed dim,
silent, and ghostly, on the hill beyond where they
were seated. His pity and hospitality led him
farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had your supper?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Bells Park shook his head in negation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can share with us,&rdquo; Dick said, getting
to his feet and entering the cabin from which
in a few moments came a rattle of fire being
replenished, a coffee-pot being refilled, and the
crisp, frying note of sizzling bacon and eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who might that young feller be?&rdquo; asked
the engineer, glowering with sudden curiosity,
after his long silence, into the face of the grizzled
old prospector, who, in the interim, had sat
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him? That&rsquo;s Dick Townsend, half-owner
in the mine,&rdquo; Bill replied.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Half owner? Cookin&rsquo; for me? Why don&rsquo;t
you do it? What right have you got sittin&rsquo; here
on your long haunches and lettin&rsquo; a boss do the
work? Hey? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his superintendent,&rdquo; grinned Bill, appreciating
the joke of being superintendent of a mine
where no one worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the engineer. And then, after
a pause, as if readjusting all these conditions to
meet his approval: &ldquo;Say, he&rsquo;s all right, ain&rsquo;t
he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet your life!&rdquo; came the emphatic
response.</p>
<p>The applicant said no more until after he had
gone into the cabin and eaten his fill, after which
he insisted on clearing away the dishes, and then
rejoined them in a less-tired mood. He squatted
down on the edge of the porch, where they sat
staring at the shadows of the glorious night, and
appeared to be thoughtful for a time, while they
were silently amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s no good, are you?&rdquo; he
suddenly asked, brandishing his pipe at Dick.
&ldquo;Well, I said you were a fool. Take it kindly,
young feller. I&rsquo;m an old man, but I know.
You&rsquo;ve been good to me. I didn&rsquo;t come here to
butt my nose in, but I know her better than you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
do. Say!&rdquo; He pivoted on his hips, and tapped
an emphatic forefinger on the warped planks
beneath in punctuation. &ldquo;There never was a set
of owners shell-gamed like them that had the
Croix d&rsquo;Or! There never was a good property so
badly handled. Two superintendents are retired
and livin&rsquo; on the money they stole from her. One
millman&rsquo;s bought himself a hotel in Seattle
with what he got away with. There was enough
ore packed off in dinner-pails from the Bonanza
Chute to heel half the men who tapped it. They
were always lookin&rsquo; for more of &rsquo;em. They
passed through a lead of ore that would have
paid expenses, on the six-hundred-foot level, and
lagged it rather than hoist it out. I know! I&rsquo;ve
seen the cars come up out of the shaft with a man
standin&rsquo; on the hundred foot to slush &rsquo;em over
with muddy sump water so the gold wouldn&rsquo;t
show until the car men could swipe the stuff and
dump it out of the tram to be picked up at night.
It ain&rsquo;t the rich streaks that pays. It&rsquo;s the four-foot
ledge that runs profit from two bits to a
couple of dollars a ton. That&rsquo;s what showed on
the six-hundred level. Get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners by this time were leaning eagerly
forward, half-inclined to believe all that had
been told them, yet willing to discount the gabbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
of the old man and find content. Until bedtime
he went on, and they listened to him the next
morning, when the slow dawn crept up, and
decided to take the plunge. And so it was that
Dick wrote a long statement of the findings to
his backer in New York and told him that he was
going to chance it and open the Croix d&rsquo;Or again
until he was satisfied, either that it would not pay
to work, or would merit larger expenditure.</p>
<p>Once again the smoke belched from the hoisting
house of the Cross, and the throb of the
pumps came, hollow and clanking, from the shaft
below. A stream of discolored water swirled
into the creek from the waste pipes, and the rainbow
trout, affrighted and disgusted, forsook its
reaches and sought the pools of the river into
which it emptied.</p>
<p>Slowly they gained on its depths, and each day
the murk swam lower, and the newly oiled cage
waited for its freshly stretched cable, one which
had happened to be coiled in the store-house.
The compressor shivered and vibrated as the
pistons drove clean, sweet air through the long-disused
pipes, and at last the partners knew they
could reach the anticipated six-hundred-foot level
and form their own conclusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; said Bill, grinning from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
under his sou&rsquo;wester as they entered the cage
with lamps in hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see how she looks
if the air pipes aren&rsquo;t broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw the slimy black sides of the shaft
slip past them as Bells Park dropped them into
the depths, and felt the cage slow down as he
saw his pointer above the drum indicate the
approach of the six-hundred-foot level. They
stepped out cautiously, whiffed the air, and knew
that the pipes, which had been protected by the
water, were intact, and that they had no need to
fear foul air. The rusted rails, slime-covered,
beneath their rubber boots, glowed a vivid red
as they inspected the timbering above, and saw
that the sparse stulls, caps, and columns were
still holding their own, and that the heavy porphyritic
formation would scarcely have given had
the timbers rotted away. Dank, glistening walls
and a tremulous waving blackness were ahead of
them as they cautiously invaded the long-deserted
precincts, scraping and striking here and there
with their prospector&rsquo;s picks in search of the lost
lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two hundred feet from the shaft,
Bells said,&rdquo; Dick commented. &ldquo;And this must be
about the place where they cut through pay ore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
in search of another lobe of the Bonanza Chute.
What thieves they were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly became aware that his companion
was not with him, and whirled round. Back of
him shone a tiny spark of flaring light, striving
to illumine the solid blackness. He paused
expectantly, and a voice came bellowing through
the dark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is. The old man&rsquo;s right, I think.
This looks like ore to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick hastened back, and assisted while they
broke away the looser pieces of green rock, glowing
dully, and filled their sample sacks.</p>
<p>Three hours later they stood over the scales
in the log assay-house above, and congratulated
each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll pay!&rdquo; Dick declared gleefully. &ldquo;Not
much, but enough to justify going on with the
work. I am glad I wrote Sloan that I should
draw on him, and now we&rsquo;ll go ahead and hire a
small gang to set the mill and the Cross in
shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were like boys when they crossed to the
engine house and told the news to the hard-worked
engineer, who chuckeled softly and
asserted that he had &ldquo;told them so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the best way for you to get a gang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
around here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to go down to Goldpan
and tell &lsquo;The Lily&rsquo; you want her to pass the
word, or stick a sign up in her place saying what
men, and how many, you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a nice name,&rdquo; Mathews commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lily?&rdquo; questioned Dick, anxious as to
who this camp character could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the engineer rasped, as if annoyed by
their ignorance. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you never heard of her?
Well, her right name, so they tell, is Lily Meredith.
She owns the place called the High Light.
Everybody knows her. She&rsquo;s square, even if
she does run a dance hall and rents a gamblin&rsquo;
joint. She don&rsquo;t stand for nothin&rsquo; crooked, Lily
don&rsquo;t. She pays her way, and asks no favors.
Go down and tell her you want men. They all
go there, some time or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped over to inspect the fire under the
small boiler he was working, and straightened up
before he went on. Through the black coating
on his face, he appeared thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best time to see The Lily and get action is at
night. All the day-shift men hang around the
camp then, and, besides that, they&rsquo;ve got a new
batch of placer ground about a mile and a half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
over the other side, and lots of them fellers come
over. Want to go to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners looked at each other, as if consulting,
and then Dick said: &ldquo;Yes. I think the
sooner the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bells Park pulled the visor of his greasy little
cap lower over his eyes, and stepped to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out here onto the yard,&rdquo; he said, and
they followed. &ldquo;Go down to the Rattler, then
bear off to the right. The trail starts in back of
the last shanty on the right-hand side. You see
that gap up yonder? Not the big one, but the
narrow one.&rdquo; He pointed with a grimy hand.
&ldquo;Well, you go right through that and drop
down, and you&rsquo;ll see the camp below you. It&rsquo;s
a stiff climb, but the trail&rsquo;s good, and it&rsquo;s just
about two miles over there. It&rsquo;s so plain you
can make it home by moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further ceremony or advice, he
returned into the boiler-room, and the partners,
after but slight preparations, began their journey.</p>
<p>It was a stiff climb! The sun had set, and the
long twilight was giving way to darkness when
they came down the trail into the upper end of
the camp. Some embryo artist was painfully
overworking an accordion, while a dog rendered
melancholy by the unmusical noise, occasionally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
accompanied him with prolonged howls. A
belated ore trailer, with the front wagon creaking
under the whine of the brakes and the chains
of the six horses clanking, lurched down from a
road on the far side of the long, straggling street,
and passed them, the horses&rsquo; heads hanging as if
overwork had robbed them of all stable-going
spirit of eagerness.</p>
<p>The steady, booming &ldquo;clumpety-clump!
clumpety-clump!&rdquo; of a stamp-mill on a shoulder
of a hill high above the camp, drowned the whir
and chirp of night insects, and from the second
story of a house they passed they heard the crude
banging of a piano, and a woman&rsquo;s strident voice
wailing, &ldquo;She may have seen better da-a-ys,&rdquo;
with a mighty effort to be pathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems right homelike! Don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Bill
grinned and chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one right nice
thing about minin&rsquo;. You can go from Dawson to
Chiapas, and a camp&rsquo;s a camp! Always the
same. I reckon if you went up the street far
enough you&rsquo;d find a Miner&rsquo;s Home Saloon,
maybe a Northern Light or two, and you can
bet on there bein&rsquo; a First Class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The High Light proved to be the most pretentious
resort in Goldpan. For one thing it had
plate-glass windows and a gorgeous sign painted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
thereon. Its double doors were wide, and at the
front was a bar with a brass rail that, by its very
brightness, told only too plainly that the evening&rsquo;s
trade had not commenced. Two bartenders,
one with a huge crest of hair waved back,
and the other with his parted in the middle, plastered
low and curled at the ends, betokened
diverse taste in barbering. A Chinese was giving
the last polish to a huge pile of glasses, thick and
heavy.</p>
<p>On the other side of the room, behind a roulette
wheel, a man who looked more like a country
parson than a gambler sat reading a thumbed
copy of Taine&rsquo;s &ldquo;English Literature.&rdquo; Three
faro layouts stretched themselves in line as if
watching for newcomers, and in the rear a man
was lighting the coal-oil lamps of the dance hall.
It was separated from the front part of the house
by an iron rail, and had boxes completely around
an upper tier and supported by log pillars
beneath, and a tiny stage with a badly worn drop
curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the boss here?&rdquo; Bill asked, pausing in
front of the man with a wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you mean&ndash;&ndash;Lily?&rdquo; was the familiar
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s over helpin&rsquo; nurse the Widder
Flannery&rsquo;s sick kids this afternoon. They&rsquo;ve got
chicken pox. Might go over there and see her
if you&rsquo;re in a rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t say we wanted to borrow money,&rdquo;
Bill retorted to the jocular latter part of the bartender&rsquo;s
speech. &ldquo;What time will she be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten, I guess,&rdquo; was the more courteous
reply.</p>
<p>The partners walked out and past the row of
buildings until they came to a general store,
where they occupied themselves in making out an
order for supplies and arranging for their delivery
on the following day. The trader was a
loquacious individual with the unmistakable
&ldquo;Yankee&rdquo; twang and nasal whine of the man
from that important speck of the United States
called New England.</p>
<p>When they again turned into the street, the
long twilight had been replaced by night, and on
the tops of the high peaks to the westward the
light of the full moon was beginning to paint the
chill white with a shining glow. The street was
filled with men, most of them scorning the narrow
board walks and traversing the roadway.
A pandemonium of sound was robbing the night
of peace through music, of assorted character,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
which boiled forth from open doors in discordant
business rivalry, but underneath it all was
the steady, dull monotone of the stamp-mill,
remorselessly beating the ore as if in eternal
industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly know the place now, eh?&rdquo; Bill said,
as they entered the open doors of the High
Light. &ldquo;It certainly keeps gettin&rsquo; more homelike.
Camp must be makin&rsquo; money, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick did not answer. He was staring at a
woman who stood at the lower end of the bar
outside, and talking to a man with a medicine case
in his hand. He surmised that she must be The
Lily, and was astonished. He had expected the
customary brazen appearance of other camp
women he had known in his years of wandering;
the hard-faced, combatative type produced by
greed. Instead, he saw a woman of perhaps
thirty years of age, or in that vague boundary
between thirty and thirty-five.</p>
<p>She was dressed in a short skirt, wore a spotless
shirt waist over an exceptionally graceful
pair of shoulders, and her hair, neatly coiled in
heavy bronze folds, was surmounted by a white
hat of the frontier type, dented in regulation
form with four hollows.</p>
<p>From the hat to the high tan boots, she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
neat and womanly; yet it was not this that
attracted him so much as her profile. From the
straight brow, down over the high, fine nose and
the firm lips to the firmer chin, the face was
perfect.</p>
<p>As if sensing his inspection, she turned toward
him, and met his wondering eyes. Her appraisement
was calm, repressed, and cold. Her face
gave him the impression that she had forgotten
how to smile. Townsend advanced toward her,
certain that she must be the proprietress of the
High Light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Miss Meredith?&rdquo; he interrogated,
as he halted in front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Meredith,&rdquo; she corrected, still unbending,
and looking at him a question as to his
business.</p>
<p>A forgotten courtesy impelled him to remove
his hat as he introduced himself, but Mathews
did not follow it when he was introduced, and
reached out and caught her competent hand with
a hard grip. Dick explained his errand, feeling,
all the time under that steady look, that he was
being measured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, they&rsquo;ll be all right by to-morrow,
Lily,&rdquo; the doctor interrupted. &ldquo;Excuse me for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
being so abrupt, but I must go now. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she answered, and then: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be up there at three o&rsquo;clock to-morrow afternoon.
Ah, you were saying you wanted&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had turned to the partners again with her
unfinished question leading them on to state their
mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men. Here&rsquo;s a list,&rdquo; Dick answered, handing
her a memorandum calling for go many millmen,
so many drill runners, swampers, car handlers,
and so forth; in all, a list of twenty odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you to come here?&rdquo; She exploded
the question as if it were vital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Park. Bells Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed mirthlessly between lips that did
not smile and regular, white teeth. But her
laugh belied her lack of sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Bells!&rdquo; she said, with a touch of
sadness in her voice. &ldquo;Poor old fool! I tried
to keep him from gambling when he had money,
and he went broke, like all the other fools. But
he loved his wife. He made her happy. Some
one in this world must be happy. So he came
back, did he? And is up there at the Cross?
Well, he&rsquo;s a faithful man. I&rsquo;m not an employment
agency, but maybe I can help you. I would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
do it for Bells. I like him. Good men are
scarce. The bums and loafers are always easy to
get. There isn&rsquo;t a mine around here that isn&rsquo;t
looking for good men, since they made that discovery
over in the flat. Most of them broke to
the placer ground. Wages are nothing when
there&rsquo;s a chance for better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not looked at Dick as she talked, but
had her eyes fixed on the paper, though not seeming
to scan its contents. The room was crowded
with men and filled with a confused volume of
sound as she spoke, the click and whir of the
wheel, the monotonous voice of the student&ndash;&ndash;turned
gambler&ndash;&ndash;calling &ldquo;Single O and the
house wins. All down?&rdquo; the sharp snap
of the case-keeper&rsquo;s buttons before the faro layouts,
the screech of the orchestra in the dance
hall, and the heavy shuffling of feet; yet her
words and intonations were distinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would like to get them as soon as we
can,&rdquo; Dick answered. &ldquo;We have unwatered the
main shaft and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the dance hall in the rear there came a
shrill, high shriek, oaths, shouts, and the orchestra
stopped playing. Men jumped to their feet
from the faro layouts, and then, mob-like, began
to surge toward the door, while in the lead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
uttering scream on scream, ran one of the dance-hall
girls with her gaudy dress bursting into
enveloping flame. She had the terror of a panic-stricken
animal flying into the danger of the open
air to die.</p>
<p>As if springing forward from live ground,
Mathews leaped into her path, and caught her in
his arms. He jammed her forward ahead of
him, taking no pains to shield her body save with
his bent arm, and seized the cover of the roulette
wheel, which lay neatly folded on the end of the
bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me room!&rdquo; he bellowed, in his heavy,
thunderous voice. &ldquo;Stop &rsquo;em, Dick! For God&rsquo;s
sake, stop &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick leaped in among the crowd that was
madly stampeding&ndash;&ndash;women with faces whose
terror showed through masks of rouge, shrieking,
men who cursed, trampled, and elbowed their
way to the outer air, and the wild-eyed musicians
seeking to escape from a fire-trap. Dick struck
right and left, and in the little space created Bill
swathed the girl in the cover, smothering the
flames. And all the time he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run. What&rsquo;s the matter with you?
Go back and put the fire out! Don&rsquo;t be idiots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As suddenly as it had commenced the panic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
subsided, and the tide turned the other way.
Sobbing women hovered round the door, and
men began to form a bucket line. In a long age
of five or ten minutes the excitement was over,
and the fire extinguished. The dance-hall floor
was littered with pieces of scorched wood torn
bodily from the boxes, and the remnants of the
lamp which had exploded and caused the havoc
were being swept into the sodden, steaming heap
in the center of the room.</p>
<p>Through the press at the sides came The Lily,
who, in the turmoil, had sought refuge behind
the bar. The partners, stooping over the unconscious,
swaddled figure on the floor, looked up at
her, and Dick saw that her face was as calm and
unemotional as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her to my room,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you where it is. You, Tim,&rdquo; she called to
one of the bartenders, &ldquo;go as quickly as you can
and get Doctor Mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners meekly followed her lead, pausing
but once, when she turned to hold up an
authoritative hand and tell the curious ones who
formed a wake that they must go back, or at least
not come ahead to make the case more difficult.
Mathews carried his senseless burden as easily
as if it were of no weight, and even as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
turned up a hallway leading to a flight of stairs
ascending to The Lily&rsquo;s apartments, the doctor
and bartender came running to join them.</p>
<p>Not until they had swathed the girl in cooling
bandages did any one speak. Then, as they drew
the sheet tenderly over her, they became conscious
of one another. As Bill looked up
through blistered eyelids, exposing a cruelly
scorched face, his lips broke into a painful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; The Lily said, &ldquo;now you had better
care for this patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her firm, white fingers out, brushed
the miner&rsquo;s singed hair back from his brow, and
said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten your name, but&ndash;&ndash;I want
to say&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re a man!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>MY LADY OF THE HORSE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It serves you right for bein&rsquo; so anxious to
help one of them dance-hall women; not
but what I&rsquo;d probably &rsquo;a&rsquo; done it myself,&rdquo;
was the croaking, querulous consolation offered
by Bells Park as he sat beside the plainly suffering
and heavily bandaged Bill that night, or rather in
the early hours of the morning, in the cabin on
the Cross. &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t no good except for
young fools to gallop around with over a floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He poured some more olive oil over the bandages,
and relented enough to add: &ldquo;All but
The Lily, and she don&rsquo;t dance with none of &rsquo;em.
She&rsquo;s all right, she is. Mighty peart looker, too.
None purtier than Dorothy Presby, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, looking up from where he sat with his
tired chin resting on his tired hands and elbows,
thought of the gruff Bully Presby with some
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so the old Rattler owner has a daughter,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean old skinflint Presby!&rdquo; sharply
corrected the engineer. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t the only
Presby in this whole United States, is he? He
don&rsquo;t own the whole world and the name, even
if he thinks he does. This Presby I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo;
about ain&rsquo;t no kin of his. He&rsquo;s too white. He
owns all them sawmills on the other side of the
Cross peak, about four miles from here. Got a
railroad of his own. Worth about a billion, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s momentary interest subsided, but he
heard the old man babbling on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worked for him once, when Dorothy was
a little bit of a kid. Him and me fought, but
he&rsquo;s a white man. She&rsquo;s been away to some of
those fool colleges for women back East, they
say, for the last four or five years. It don&rsquo;t do
women no good to know too much. My wife
couldn&rsquo;t read or write, and she was the best
woman that ever lived, bar none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around as if delivering a challenge,
and, finding that no one was paying any attention
to him, subsided, fidgeted for a minute, and then
said he guessed he&rsquo;d &ldquo;turn in so&rsquo;s the water
wouldn&rsquo;t gain on the pumps in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the insistent demand of his partner, Dick
also retired shortly, and the cabin on the hillside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
was dark save for the dim light that glowed in
the sufferer&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>They began to straggle in, the men wanted,
before the partners had finished their breakfast
on the following morning. Some of them were
real miners, and others were nondescripts, bearing
out The Lily&rsquo;s statement that good men were
scarce, but all were hired as they came, and the
Croix d&rsquo;Or began to thrill with activity.</p>
<p>A fat cook&ndash;&ndash;and no miner can explain why a
camp cook is always fat&ndash;&ndash;beamed from the mess-house
door. A blacksmith, accepting the ready
name of &ldquo;Smuts,&rdquo; oiled the rusted wheels of
his blower, and swore patiently and softly at a
new helper as he selected the drills for sharpening.
Three Burley drill runners tinkered
with their machines, and scraped off the verdigris
and accumulated dust of storage; millmen
began to reset the tables, strip the damaged
plates, and lay in new water pipes to drip ceaselessly
over the powered ore. Over all these
watched Bill with his bandaged face, rumbling
orders here and there, and tirelessly active. Out
on the pipe line, winding by cut and trestle from
the reservoir in the high hills, Dick superintended
repairs and laid plans.</p>
<p>Leaving his gang replacing sections near the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
power-house, he climbed up the length of the line
to discover, if possible, how far the labors of the
vandal had extended. Foot by foot he had traversed
it, almost to the reservoir itself, when he
paused to breathe and look off at the mountains
spread below and around.</p>
<p>The Cross, in the distance, was softened again
to a miracle of dim yellow laid against a field of
purple, and, like a speck, a huge eagle swept in
circles round its point to come to rest on its
extreme summit. He turned from admiring its
flight to inspect a bowlder that had tumbled down
from the slope above and come to rest in a big
dent; it had smashed in the top of the pipe. He
picked up a piece of a storm-broken limb, used
it as a lever, and sent the rock crashing across the
pipe to go bounding down the hillside as it gained
momentum with every leap.</p>
<p>There was a startled snort, a sudden threshing
of the brush, and it parted to disclose a girl
astride a horse that was terrified and endeavoring
his best to dismount his rider. Dick, surmising
that horse and rider had suffered a narrow
escape from the bowlder, ran toward them
remorsefully, but the girl already had the animal
in control after a display of splendid horsemanship.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, as he hastened toward
the horse&rsquo;s head, intent on seizing the snaffle.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t touch him. I can quiet him
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; he pleaded, with his hat in
his hand. &ldquo;I had no idea that any one ever rode
up this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; she answered, with a careless
laugh. &ldquo;No one ever does, save me. It&rsquo;s
an old and favorite view of mine. I used to ride
here, to see the Cross, many years ago, before
I went away to school. So I came back to see
my old friend, and&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;your bowlder would
have struck us if my horse hadn&rsquo;t jumped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed again, and reached a yellow-gauntleted
hand down to pat her mount&rsquo;s shoulder
with a soothing caress. The horse stopped
trembling, and looked at Dick with large, intelligent
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Dick, remembering the garrulity
of the engineer. &ldquo;I believe you must be Miss
Presby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she said simply: &ldquo;I am, but how did
you know? I don&rsquo;t remember ever seeing you,&rdquo;
he took note of her modish blue riding-dress with
divided skirts and patent-leather boots. There
was a clean freshness about her person, a smiling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
candor in her eyes, and a fine, frank girlishness
in her face that attracted him beyond measure.
She appeared to be about twenty years of age,
and was such a girl as those he had known and
danced with, in those distant university days
when his future seemed assured, and life a joyous
conquest with all the odds in his favor. Now
she was of another world, for he was, after all,
but a workingman, while she, the daughter of a
millionaire lumberman, would dance and associate
with those other university men whose financial
incomes enabled them to dawdle as they
pleased through life. He had no bitterness in
this summary, but he sustained an instant&rsquo;s longing
for a taste of that old existence, and the camaraderie
of such girls as the one who sat before
him on her horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, looking up at her, &ldquo;you never
saw me before. I have been in the Blue Mountains
but six weeks. I am Richard Townsend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face took on a look of aroused interest,
different from the casual look she had been giving
him in the brief minute of their meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;then you must be the Mr.
Townsend of the Croix d&rsquo;Or. I learned of
your arrival last night after I came home. You
are rehabilitating the old mine?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. &ldquo;At least we
are trying to. As to the outcome&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;Faith in anything is the first requisite for success.
That&rsquo;s what it says in the copybooks,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed again in her clear, mezzo voice,
and then with a resumption of gravity gathered
her reins into a firmer grip, and, as her horse
lifted his head in response to the summons, said:
&ldquo;Anyway, I thank you for volunteering to rescue
me, Mr. Townsend, and wish you lots of good
luck, but please don&rsquo;t start any more bowlders
down the hill, because if you do I shall be robbed
of my most enjoyable trip each day. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he called to her, as she
started away. &ldquo;There are no more bowlders to
roll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood and watched her as she rode, masterfully
seated on the black horse, around a crag
that stuck out into the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Faith in anything is the first requisite for
success,&rsquo;&rdquo; he repeated to himself, striving to
recall whether or not it was, as she had intimated,
a hackneyed proverb for the young; yet there was
something bracing in it, coming from her calm,
young, womanly lips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it; she has it,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
he again said to himself. &ldquo;&lsquo;Faith.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
what I need.&rdquo; And he resumed his tramp up
the mountainside with a better courage and more
hope for the Croix d&rsquo;Or. He was still vaguely
troubled when he made his way back past the
power-house, in a sliding, scrambling descent,
his boots starting tiny avalanches of shale and
loose rock to go clattering down the mountainside.</p>
<p>The new men were proving competent under
the direction of a boss pipeman who had been
made foreman, and Dick trudged away toward
the mine, feeling that one part of the work, at
least, would be speedily accomplished.</p>
<p>Bill was still striding backward and forward,
but devoting most of his attention to cleaning up
the mill, and declared, with a wry smile, that he
never felt better in his life, but never liked talking
less.</p>
<p>When the noon whistle shrieked its high, staccato
note from the engine-house, they went up to
the mess, and seated themselves at the head of
the table. As a whole, the men were fairly satisfactory.
Bill stared coldly down the table, and
appeared to be mentally tabulating those who
would draw but one pay-check, and that when
their &ldquo;time&rdquo; was given them, but Dick&rsquo;s mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
persisted in wandering afield to the chance
encounter of the morning.</p>
<p>The men had finished their hasty meal, in hasty
miner&rsquo;s fashion, silently, and tramped, with
clumping feet, out of the mess-house to the shade
of its northern side before Bill had ended his
painful repast. Whiffs of tobacco smoke and
voices came through the open windows, where the
miners lounged and rested on a long bench while
waiting for the whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fool yourself about Bully Presby,&rdquo;
one of them was saying. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true he&rsquo;s a hard
man, and out for the dust every minute of his life,
but he&rsquo;s got nerve, all right. He&rsquo;ll bulldoze and
fight and growl and gouge, but he&rsquo;s there in other
ways. I don&rsquo;t like him, and we quit pretty sudden,
yet I saw him do somethin&rsquo; once that beat
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you work on the Rattler?&rdquo; another
voice queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the other went on, &ldquo;I worked for him
down on the Placer Belle in California. It was
under the old system and was a small mine. Kept
all the dynamite on the hundred-foot level in an
old chamber. Every man went there to get it
when it was time to load his holes. I was startin&rsquo;
for mine one evenin&rsquo;, whistlin&rsquo; along, when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
smelled smoke. Stopped and sniffed, and about
weakened. Knowed it was comin&rsquo; from the
powder room down there. It wan&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n
twenty feet from the shaft, and there was two or
three tons of it in that hole. Ran back and gave
the alarm bell to the engineer, then ducked my
head and went toward the smoke to see if anything
could be done before she blew up the whole
works. On his hands and knees, with all that
was left of his coat, was Bully. He&rsquo;d got the fire
nearly smothered out, and we coughed and spit,
and drowned the rest of the sparks from the
water barrel. He&rsquo;d fought it to a finish all alone,
and I had to drag him out to the cage that was
slidin&rsquo; up and down as if the engineer was on a
drunk, and every time it went up I could see the
boys&rsquo; faces, kind of white, and worried, and hear
the alarms bangin&rsquo; away like mad. But he&rsquo;d put
the fire out there with all that stuff around him.
That took some nerve, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do for you?&rdquo; asked another
voice.</p>
<p>The narrator gave a heavy laugh, and chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do for me? When he got fresh air in him
again, up in the hoist, he sat up and opened his
hand. In it was a candlestick and a snipe, burned
on the side till the wick looked about a foot long.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
&lsquo;Who owns this candlestick?&rsquo; says he. No one
spoke, but some of us knowed it belonged to old
Deacon Wells, an absent-minded old cuss, but
the deacon had a family of nigh on to ten kids.
So nobody answered. &lsquo;Some fool left this here,&rsquo;
Bully bellowed, tearing around. &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s
what started the fire. I&rsquo;ll kick the man off the
works that owns the stick.&rsquo; Still nobody said
anything. He caught me grinnin&rsquo;. &lsquo;You know
who it was,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Sure I do,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but
I&rsquo;m a little tongue-tied.&rsquo; Then he told me he&rsquo;d
fire me if I didn&rsquo;t say who it was. &lsquo;Give me my
time-check,&rsquo; says I, and he gave it. He found
out afterward I was the man that dragged him
out, and sent a letter up to Colusa askin&rsquo; me to
come back, but I didn&rsquo;t go. Don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;d
remember me now, and don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;d want
him to. Any man that works for Bully comes
about as near givin&rsquo; away his heart&rsquo;s blood as any
one could, and live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices went rumbling on, and Dick sat
thinking of the strange, powerful man of the
Rattler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of the millmen know their business,&rdquo;
mumbled Bill, as if all the time he had been mentally
appraising his force. &ldquo;Two are rumdums.
The chips isn&rsquo;t bad. He could carpenter anywhere,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
and if he&rsquo;s as smart a timberman as he
is millwright, will make good. The engineer
that&rsquo;s to relieve Bells ain&rsquo;t so much, but I&rsquo;ll leave
it to Bells to cuss him into line. That goes. Two
of the Burley men are all right, and I fired the
third in the first hour because he didn&rsquo;t know
what was the nut and which the wrench. Smuts is
a gem. He put the pigeon-blue temper on a
bunch of drills as fast as any man could have
done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick did not answer, but concentrated his mind
on the work ahead. The whistle blew, and he
compelled Bill to submit to new bandages, following
the doctor&rsquo;s instructions, and smiled at his
steady swearing as the wrappings were removed
and the blisters redressed. They walked across
to the hoist, entered the cage, and felt the sinking
sensation as they were dropped, rather than lowered,
to the six-hundred-foot level. The celerity
of the descent almost robbed him of breath, but
he thought of sturdy old Bells&rsquo; boast, that he
had &ldquo;never run a cage into the sheaves, nor
dropped it to the sump, in forty years of steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lights glowed ahead of them, and they heard
hammering. The suck of fresh air under pressure,
vapored like steam, whirled around them
in gusts, and the water oozed and rippled beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
their feet as they went forward. The carpenter
was putting in a new set of timbers, and his task
was nearly finished, while beside him waited a
drill man and a swamper with the cumbersome,
spiderlike mechanism ready to set. The carpenter
gave a few more blows to a key block, and
methodically flung his hammer into his box and
hurried back out through the tunnel toward the
cage, intent on resuming his work at the mill.</p>
<p>Bill tentatively inspected the timbers, tapped
the roof with a pick taken from the swamper&rsquo;s
hands, heard the true ring of live rock, and
backed away. The drill was drawn up to the
green face of ore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About there, I should say,&rdquo; Dick directed,
pointing an indicatory finger, and the drill runner
nodded.</p>
<p>The swamper, who appeared to know his business,
came forward with the coupling which fed
compressed air to the machine, the runner gave
a last inspection of his drill, turned his chuck
screw, setting it against the rocky face, and signaled
for the air. With a clatter like the discharge
of a rapid-fire gun, the steel bit into the
rock, and the Cross was really a mine again.
Spattered with mud, and satisfied that the new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
drift was working in pay, the partner trudged
back out.</p>
<p>They signaled for the cage, shot upward, and
emerged to the yard near the blacksmith&rsquo;s tunnel
in time to see a huge bay horse, with a woman
rider, come toiling up the slope. There was
something familiar about the white hat, and as
she neared them they recognized The Lily. Before
they could assist her to dismount, she leaped
from the saddle, landing lightly on her toes, and
dropped the horse&rsquo;s reins over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day&ndash;&ndash;never mind&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;ll stand,&rdquo; she
said, all in a breath, striding toward them with
an extended hand.</p>
<p>Dick accepted it with a firm grip, and lifted
his hat, while Bill merely shook hands and tried
to smile. It was to him that she turned solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are out,&rdquo; she remarked, without
lowering her eyes which swept over the bandages
on his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But how&rsquo;s that girl? It don&rsquo;t matter
much about an old cuss like me. Girls are a heap
scarcer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owner of the High Light looked troubled
for a moment, and removed her gloves before
answering.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Mills says she will live,&rdquo; she said
quietly, &ldquo;but she is terribly burned. She will be
so disfigured that she can never work in a dance
hall any more. It&rsquo;s pretty rough luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick recoiled and felt a chill at this hard, cold
statement. The girl could never work in a dance
hall any more! And this was accepted as a calamity!
Accustomed as he was to the frontier, this
matter-of-fact acceptance of a dance-hall occupation
as something desirable impressed him with its
cynicism. Not that he doubted the virtue of
many of those forlorn ones who gayly tripped
their feet over rough boards, and drank tea or
ginger ale and filled their pockets with bar checks
to make a living as best they might, but because
the whole garish, rough, drink-laden, curse-begrimed
atmosphere of a camp dance hall
revolted him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Meredith had intuition, and read men as
she read books, understandingly. She arose to
the defense of her sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, facing him, as if he had voiced
his sentiment, &ldquo;what would you have? Women
are what men make them, no better, no worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made no criticism,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you thought one,&rdquo; she asserted.
&ldquo;But, pshaw! I didn&rsquo;t come here to argue. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
came up to tell you that the dance-hall girl will
recover and has friends who will see that she
doesn&rsquo;t starve, even if she no longer works in
my place. Also, I came to see how Mister&ndash;&ndash;what
is your name, anyway?&ndash;&ndash;is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mathews, ma&rsquo;am. William Mathews. My
friends call me Bill. I don&rsquo;t allow the others to
call me anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temporary and threatening cloud was dissipated
by the miner&rsquo;s rumbling laugh, and they
sauntered across the yard, the bay horse looking
after them, but standing as firmly as if the
loosened reins were tied to a post instead of resting
on the ground. A swamper, carrying a bundle
of drills, trudged across the yard to the blacksmith
shop, as they stood in its doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent you the best men I could pick up,&rdquo; The
Lily said. &ldquo;You did me a good turn, and I did
my best to pay it back. That blacksmith is all
right. Some of the others I know, but I don&rsquo;t
know him. Never saw him before. You&rsquo;d better
watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed at the swamper as coolly as if he
were an inanimate object, and he glared at her
in return, then dropped his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I didn&rsquo;t run an employment
agency,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but if any of these fellows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
get fresh, let me know, and I&rsquo;ll try to get
you others. How does the Cross look, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned away and accompanied her over
the plant above ground, and heard her greet man
after man on a level of comradeship, as if she
were but a man among men. Her hard self-possession
and competence impressed the younger
man as a peculiar study. It seemed to him, as he
walked beside her thoughtfully, that every
womanly trait had been ground from her in the
stern mills of circumstance. He had a vague
desire to probe into her mind and learn whether
or not there still dwelt within it the softness of
her sex, but he dared not venture. He stood
beside the bandaged veteran as she rode away, a
graceful, independent figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she all tiger, or part woman?&rdquo; he said,
turning to Mathews, whose eyes had a singularly
thoughtful look.</p>
<p>The latter turned to him with a quick gesture,
and threw up his unbandaged hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not a half of anything.
She&rsquo;s all tiger, or all woman! God only
knows!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE WOMAN UNAFRAID</h3>
</div>
<p>They were to have another opportunity to
puzzle over the character of The Lily
before a week passed, when, wishing to
make out a new bill of supplies, they went down
to the camp. The night was fragrant with the
spring of the mountains, summer elsewhere&ndash;&ndash;down
in the levels where other occupations than
mining held rule. The camp had the same dead
level of squalor in appearance, the same twisting,
wriggling, reckless life in its streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine new lot of stuff in,&rdquo; the trader said,
pushing his goods in a brisk way. &ldquo;Never been a
finer lot of stuff brought into any camp than I&rsquo;ve
got here now. Canned tomatoes, canned corn,
canned beans, canned meat, canned tripe, canned
salmon. That&rsquo;s a pretty big layout, eh? And
I reckon there never was no better dried prunes
and dried apricots ever thrown across a mule&rsquo;s
back than I got. Why, they taste as if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
was eatin&rsquo; &rsquo;em right off the bushes! And Mexican
beans! Hey, look at these! Talk about
beans and sowbelly, how would these do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He plunged his grimy hand into a sack, and
lifted a handful of beans aloft to let them sift
through his fingers, clattering, on those below.
The partners agreed that he had everything in the
world that any one could crave in the way of delicacies,
and gave him their orders; then, that
hour&rsquo;s task completed, sauntered out into the
street.</p>
<p>Dick started toward the trail leading homeward,
but Bill checked him, with a slow: &ldquo;Hold
on a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger man turned back, and waited for
him to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d kind of like to go down to the High Light
for a while,&rdquo; the big man said awkwardly. &ldquo;We
ought to go round there and see Mrs. Meredith,
and patronize her as far as a few soda pops, and
such go, hadn&rsquo;t we? Seein&rsquo; as how she&rsquo;s been
right good to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, nothing loath to a visit to The Lily, assented,
although the High Light, with its camp
garishness, was an old and familiar sight to any
one who had passed seven years in outlying
mining regions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>The proprietress was not in sight when they entered,
but the bartenders greeted them in a more
friendly way, and the Chinese, who seemed forever
cleaning glasses, grinned them a welcome.
They nodded to those they recognized, and
walked back to the little railing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookin&rsquo; for Lily?&rdquo; the man with the bangs
asked, trying to show his friendliness. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t
here now, but she&rsquo;ll be here soon. She&rsquo;s about
due. Go on up and grab a box for yourselves.
The house owes you fellers a drink, it seems to
me. Can I send you up a bottle of Pumbry?
The fizzy stuff&rsquo;s none too good for you, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appeared disappointed when Dick told him
to send up two lemonades, and turned back to lean
across the bar and hail some new arrival. The
partners went up and seated themselves in one of
the cardboard stalls dignified by the name of
boxes, and, leaning over the railing in front between
the gilt-embroidered, red-denim curtains,
looked down on the dancers. Two or three of
their own men were there, grimly waltzing with
girls who tried to appear cheerful and joyous.</p>
<p>Shrill laughter echoed now and then, and when
the music changed a man with a voice like a megaphone
shouted: &ldquo;Gents! Git pardners for the
square sets!&rdquo; and the scene shifted into one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
more regular pattern, where different individuals
were more conspicuous. Some of the more hilarious
cavorted, and tried clumsy shuffles on the
corners when the raucous-voiced man howled:
&ldquo;Bala-a-ance all!&rdquo; and others merely jigged up
and down with stiff jerks and muscle-bound limbs,
gravely, and with a desperate, earnest endeavor
to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>A glowering, pockmarked man, evidently seeking
some one with no good intent, pulled open the
curtains at the back of the box, and stared at them
in half-drunken gravity; then discovering his
mistake, with a clumsy &ldquo;Beg pardon, gents,&rdquo; let
the draperies drop, and passed on down the row.</p>
<p>Across from them, in the opposite box, some
man from the placers, with his face tanned to a
copper color, was hilariously surrounding himself
with all the girls he could induce to become his
guests, holding a box party of his own. He was
leaning over the rail and bellowing so loudly that
his voice could be heard above the din: &ldquo;Hey,
down there! You, Tim! Bring me up a bottle
of the bubbly water&ndash;&ndash;two bottles&ndash;&ndash;five&ndash;&ndash;no, send
up a case. Whoop-ee! Pay on seventeen! This
is where little Hank Jones celebrates! Come on
up, girls. Here&rsquo;s where no men is wanted. It&rsquo;s
me all by my little lonely!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>Some one threw a garland of paper flowers
round his neck, which he esteemed as a high
honor, and shook it out over the floor below,
where all the dancers were becoming confused in
an endeavor simultaneously to watch his antics,
and keep their places in the dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most disgusting object in the world is
a man who drinks!&rdquo; came a cold voice behind
them, and they turned to see The Lily standing
back of them, and frowning at the scene across.</p>
<p>Bill turned to greet her, holding out his hand,
and his broad shoulders shut out the view of
Bacchanalia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bartender says you drink nothing
stronger than lemonade,&rdquo; she said, looking up at
the giant, &ldquo;and I am glad to hear it. It is a
pleasure to meet men like you once in a while.
It keeps one from losing faith in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat down in one of the chairs&ndash;&ndash;a trifle
wearily, Dick thought, and he noticed that there
were lines under the eyebrows, melancholy, pensive,
that he had not observed before in the few
times they had met her. As on the occasion of
their meeting at the mine, she appeared to sense
his thoughts, and turned toward him as if to
defend herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are asking yourself and me the question,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
why, if I dislike liquor, and gambling, and all
this, I am owner of the High Light?&rdquo; she said,
reverting to her old-time hardness. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s
because I want money. Does that answer you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you a question,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s just like it always is with you!
You looked one. I&rsquo;m not sure that I like you;
you look so devilish clean-minded. You always
accuse me, without saying anything so that I can
have a chance to answer back. It isn&rsquo;t fair. I
don&rsquo;t like to be made uncomfortable. I am what
I am, and can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her frowning eyes on Bill, and they
softened. She relented, and for the first time
in the evening her rare laugh sounded softly from
between her white, even teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, addressing him, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
help being angry with Mr. Townsend. I think
I&rsquo;m a little afraid of him. I&rsquo;m a coward in
some ways. You&rsquo;re different. You just smile
kindly at me, as if you were older than Methuselah,
and had all the wisdom of Solomon or
Socrates, and were inclined to be tolerant when
you couldn&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; all the
talkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a right to exercise at least one womanly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
prerogative, once in a while,&rdquo; she laughed.
And then: &ldquo;But I am talking more than usual.
Tell me about the mine and the men? How
goes it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had but little to tell her, yet she seemed
to find it interesting, and her eyes had the
absent look of one who listens and sees distant
scenes under discussion to the exclusion of all
immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you met Bully Presby yet?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>They smiled, and told her they had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a wonderful man,&rdquo; she said admiringly.
&ldquo;He makes his way over everything and
everybody. He is ruthless in going after what
he wants. He fears nothing above or below.
I honestly believe that if the arch demon were
to block him on the trail, Bully Presby would
take a chance and try to throw him over a cliff.
I don&rsquo;t suppose he ever had a vice or a human
emotion. I believe I&rsquo;d like him better if he had
a little of both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed outright, and stared at her with
renewed interest. He admitted to himself that
she was one of the most fascinating women he
had ever met, and wondered what vicissitude
could have brought such a woman, who used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
classical illustrations, fluent, cultivated speech,
and who was strong grace exemplified, to such a
position. She seemed master of her surroundings,
and yet not of them, looking down with a
hard and lofty scorn on the very men from
whom she made her living. He began to
believe what was commonly said of her, that
her virtue, physical and ethical, was unassailable.</p>
<p>There was a crash and a loud guffaw of
laughter. They pulled the curtains farther
apart, and looked across at the man who was
celebrating. He had dropped a bottle of wine to
the floor below, and was beseeching some one
to bring it up to him.</p>
<p>Bill leaned farther out of the box to look,
and suddenly the drummer saw him, pointed in
his direction with a drumstick, and spoke to a
girl leaning near by. She, too, looked up, and
then clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; she called in her high treble
voice. &ldquo;Up there in number five! The man
that carried Pearl out and got burned himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some man near her climbed to the little stage
and pointed, took off his hat, and shouted: &ldquo;A
tiger for that man! Now! All together!
Whooee! Whooee! Whooee! Ow!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>In the wild yell that every one joined, Bill
was abashed. He shrank back into the box,
flushed and embarrassed, while Dick laughed outright,
with boyish enjoyment at his confusion,
and The Lily watched him with a soft look in
her eyes, and then stared down at the floor below.</p>
<p>Suddenly her figure seemed to stiffen, and the
look on her face altered to one of cold anger.
She peered farther over as if to assure herself
of something, and Dick, following her eyes, saw
they were fixed on a man who stood leaning
against one of the pillars near the entrance to
the dance floor. He alone, apparently, was
taking no part in the demonstration in Bill&rsquo;s
honor, but glowered sullenly toward the box. It
took no long reasoning for Dick to know why.
The man was the one who had been the watchman
at the mine when they arrived.</p>
<p>The band struck up again, and another
dance began, the enthusiasts forgetting Bill as
quickly as they had saluted him; but the
ex-watchman continued to lean against the post, a
picture of sullenness, and in the box The Lily
stood with knitted brows, as if trying to recollect
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I must go now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
Come and see me whenever you can, both of you.
I like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They arose and followed her out of the box,
and down the flimsy stairs that led to the floor
below. She paused on the bottom step, and
clutched the casing with both hands, then tried
to get a closer look at the ex-watchman, who
had turned away until but a small part of his
face was exposed. She walked onward, still
looking angrily preoccupied, to the end of the
bar, and the partners were on the point of bidding
her good-night, when she abruptly started,
seemed to tense herself, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Now
I know him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners wondered when she made a
swift clutch under the end of the bar and slipped
something into the bosom of her jacket. She
took five or six determined steps toward the
ex-watchman and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>He whirled sharply as if his mind had guilty
fears, and faced her defiantly.</p>
<p>Those immediately around, suspecting something
unusual, stopped to watch them, and
listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are here in Goldpan, are you, Wolff?&rdquo;
she demanded, with a cold sneer in her voice.</p>
<p>He gave her a fierce, defiant stare, and brazenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
growled: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re off. My name&rsquo;s not
Wolff. My name&rsquo;s Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; she flared back, with a hard
anger in her voice. &ldquo;Your name is Gus Wolff!
You get out of this place, and don&rsquo;t you ever
come in again! If you do, I&rsquo;ll have you thrown
out like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glowered at the crowd that was forming
around him, as crowds invariably form in any
controversy, and then started toward the door,
but he made a grave mistake. He called back a
vile epithet as he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she commanded him, with an imperious,
compelling tone.</p>
<p>He half-turned, and then shrugged his shoulders,
and made as if to move on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, I said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned again to face a pistol which she
had snatched from her jacket, and now the partners,
amazed, understood what that swift motion
had meant. He halted irresolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used a name toward me that I permit
no man to use,&rdquo; she said fiercely. &ldquo;So I shall
explain to these men of Goldpan who you are,
Gus Wolff! You were in Butte five years ago.
You induced a poor, silly little fool named Rose
Trevor to leave the dance hall where she worked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and go with you. You were one of those who
believe that women are made to be brutalized.
But good as most of them are, and bad as some
of them are, there is none, living or dead,
that you are or were fit to consort with.
You murdered her. Don&rsquo;t you dare to deny
it! They found her dead outside of your
cabin. They arrested you, and tried you, and
should have hanged you, but they couldn&rsquo;t get
the proof of what everybody believed, that you&ndash;&ndash;you
brute&ndash;&ndash;had killed, then thrown her over
the rocks to claim that she had fallen there in
the darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused as if the tempest of her words had
left her breathless, and men glared at him savagely.
It seemed as if every one had crowded
forward to hear her denunciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she added scornfully. &ldquo;The jury
was made up of fools, and men knew it. The
sheriff himself told you so when he slipped you
out of the jail where he had protected you, and
let you loose across the border in the night.
Didn&rsquo;t he? And he told you that if ever you
came back to Butte, he would not turn a hand
to keep you from the clutches of the mob; didn&rsquo;t
he? And now you are plain &lsquo;Mister Brown,&rsquo;
working somewhere back up in the hills, are you?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
Well, Mr. Brown, you keep away from the High
Light. Get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some one made a restless motion, and
declared the man should be hanged, even now,
but The Lily turned her angry eyes on the
speaker, and silenced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it, or any of my friends
can,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no mobbing
anybody around here. I&rsquo;ve said enough. Let
him alone, but remember what kind of a blackguard
he is. That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned back and tossed the pistol behind
the bar, and the crowd, as if her words and the
advice of the more contained element prevailed,
resumed its play. She looked up, and saw the
partners waiting to bid her good-night, and suddenly
bit her lip, as if ashamed that they had
seen her fury unmasked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going now,&rdquo; Bill said, reaching out
his hand. She did not take it, but looked
around the room with unreadable eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk with you to the beginning of your
trail,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of this,&rdquo; and led the
way out into the night.</p>
<p>For half the length of the long street, she
strode between them, wordless, and then suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
halted and held her arms apart appealingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must you think of me?&rdquo; she said,
with a note of grief in her voice. &ldquo;Oh, you two
don&rsquo;t know it all! You don&rsquo;t know what it takes
to make a woman, who tries to be decent, rebellious
at everything under the skies. What brutes
there are walking the earth! Sometimes, lately,
I begin to doubt if there is a God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; exclaimed the quiet, steadfast
young voice at her side, &ldquo;is unworthy of you and
your intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She halted again, as if thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the giant, in his deep, musical
tones, &ldquo;know there&rsquo;s one. It takes more than
men to make me believe there ain&rsquo;t. I know it
when I look at them!&rdquo; He waved his hands at
the starlit mountains surrounding them, and
towering in serenity high up to the cloudless
spaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be mighty ashamed to doubt when I can
see them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if they went away,
I&rsquo;d still believe it; because if I didn&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t
see no use in livin&rsquo; any more. It&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; Him
lean down and whisper to you once in a while, in
the night, when everything seems to be goin&rsquo;
wrong, &lsquo;Old boy, you did well,&rsquo; that keeps it all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
worth while and makes a feller stiffen his back
and go ahead, with his conscience clean and not
carin&rsquo; a cuss what anybody says or thinks, so
longs as he knows that the Lord knows he did
the right thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She faltered for a moment, and Dick, staring
through the darkness at her, could not decide
whether it was because the woman in her was
melting after the storm of anger, or whether
she was merely weighing his partner&rsquo;s words.
As abruptly as had been any of her actions in
all the time they had known her, she turned and
walked away from them, her soft &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo;
wafting itself back with a note of profound
sadness and misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided what she is,&rdquo; Bill said, as they
paused for a last look at the lights of the camp.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all woman, and a mighty good one, at
that!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE INCONSISTENT BULLY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Them beans,&rdquo; declared the fat cook,
plaintively, &ldquo;looks as if they had been
put through some sort of shrivelin&rsquo;
process. The dried prunes are sure dry all right!
Must have been put up about the time they dried
them mummy things back in Egypt. Apuricots?
Humph! I soaked some of &rsquo;em all day and to-night
took one over to the shop and cut it open
with a chisel to see if it was real leather, or only
imitation. The canned salmon, and the canned
tripe is all swells so that the cans is round
instead of flat on the ends. I reckon you&rsquo;d better
go down and see that storekeeper. I dassen&rsquo;t!
If I did I&rsquo;d probably lose my temper and
wallop him. If somebody don&rsquo;t go, the men
here&rsquo;ll be makin&rsquo; a mistake, blamin&rsquo; it on me, and
I can&rsquo;t exactly see how they could keep from
hangin&rsquo; me, if they want to do justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had stood in the doorway of the office to
voice his complaint, and now, without further
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
words walked away toward his own particular
section of the little camp village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way that trader down there
filled the order, is it?&rdquo; Dick said, frowning at
his companion.</p>
<p>The latter merely grunted and then offered a
solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that stuff was sent up
here without bein&rsquo; opened, just as he got it. If
that&rsquo;s so it ain&rsquo;t his fault. About half the rows
in life come from takin&rsquo; things for granted. The
other half because we know too well how things
did happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up and stretched his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say we go down and hear what
the trader has to say? If he&rsquo;s square he&rsquo;ll make
good. If he ain&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll make him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking it for granted that the younger man
would accompany him, he was already slipping off
his working shirt and peering around the corners
of the room for his clean boots. Dick hesitated
and had to be urged. He wondered then if it
were not possible that something beside the
errand to the trader&rsquo;s caused Bill&rsquo;s eagerness; but
wisely kept the idea to himself.</p>
<p>The camp was in the dusk when they entered
it, the soft dusk that falls over early summer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
evenings in the hills, when everything in nature
seems drowsily awaiting the night. They
thought there was an unusual hush in the manner
of those they met. Men talked on the corners
or in groups in the roadway with unaccustomed
earnestness. Women leaned across window sills
and chatted across intervening spaces with an
air of anxiety; the very dogs in the street appeared
to be subdued. At the trader&rsquo;s there was
not the usual small gathering of loungers, squatted
sociably around on cracker boxes and packing
cases, and the man with the twang was alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, there&rsquo;s something wrong with that
stuff you sent us,&rdquo; Bill began, and the trader
answered with a soft, absent-minded, &ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill repeated the words of the cook; but the
storekeeper continued to stare out of the door as
if but half of what was said proved interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send up and bring it back to-morrow,&rdquo;
he replied when the miner had concluded his
complaint. &ldquo;The fact is it&rsquo;s a job lot I bought
in Portland, and I didn&rsquo;t look at it. Came in
yesterday. I ain&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I ain&rsquo;t exactly feelin&rsquo; right.
I suppose you heard about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners looked at him questioningly, but
he did not shift his eyes from the door through
which he still appeared to be staring away into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
distance, and it was easy to conjecture, from the
expression of his eyes, that he was seeing a
tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sort of busted up,&rdquo; he went on, without
looking at them. &ldquo;You see I had a brother
over there. A shift boss, he was. Him and me
was more than brothers. We was friends. It
don&rsquo;t seem right that Hiram was down there, in
the dark, when the big cave came&ndash;&ndash;came just as
if the whole mountain wanted to smash them men
under it. It don&rsquo;t seem right! I can&rsquo;t quite get
it all yet. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; over there on the stage in
the mornin&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s left a widder and a couple of
little shavers. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to bring &rsquo;em here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t quite understand you,&rdquo; Dick said,
hesitatingly, and with sympathy in his voice.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard about it&ndash;&ndash;whatever it is. I&rsquo;m
sorry if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader straightened up from where he had
been leaning on his elbows across the counter and
they saw that his face was drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; he said, in the same slow, hopeless
voice. &ldquo;I forgot you men don&rsquo;t come down
here very often and that my driver never has anything
to say to anybody. Why, it&rsquo;s the Blackbird
mine over across the divide&ndash;&ndash;on the east spur.
Bad, old fashioned mine she was, with crawlin&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
ground. Lime streaks all through the formation
and plenty of water. Nobody quite knows how
it happened. There was a big slip over there a
few days ago on the four-hundred-foot level.
Thirty odd men back of it. Timbers went off,
they say, like a gatlin&rsquo; gun. I just can&rsquo;t seem to
understand how they didn&rsquo;t handle that ground
better. It don&rsquo;t look right to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped and twisted his fingers together
and the palms of his hands gave out dry, rasping
sounds. His attitude seemed inconsistent
with the immobility of his face, but Dick surmised
that he was trying to regain control of his emotions.
He had a keen desire to know more of
the particulars of the tragedy, but sensed from
the storekeeper&rsquo;s appearance that he was scarcely
able to give a coherent account of it. His words
had already told his sorrow. Bill&rsquo;s voice broke
the pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re right sorry we bothered you about the
supplies,&rdquo; he said, softly. &ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t know,
you see. I reckon we ain&rsquo;t in any big hurry.
You just take your time about fixin&rsquo; it up. We
can live on most anything for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storekeeper looked at him gratefully and
then lowered his eyes again. He turned away
from them with a long sigh.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Much obliged. I&rsquo;ll send
my man up to-morrow. Business keeps a-goin&rsquo; on
just the same, no matter who passes out. If you
or me died to-night, the whole world would just
keep joggin&rsquo; along. I&rsquo;ll send up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned and walked out, feeling that anything
they could say would be useless, and sound
hollow, and they did not speak until they were
some distance farther up the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hard hit, poor cuss!&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;Wonder
what the rest of it was. Lets go on up toward
the High Light. Seems as if it must have
been pretty bad. What&rsquo;s the commotion down
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead of them they saw men clustering toward
a central point, and others who had been in the
street hurrying forward to be absorbed into the
group. They quickened their steps a trifle, speculating
as to whether it could mean a brawl, or
something relating to the disaster of which they
had just learned. It proved the latter. A man
was standing in the center of the gathering crowd
with the reins of a tired horse hanging loosely
over his arm. He was talking to the doctor, who
was asking him questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bill and Dick heard him say as they
crowded into the group, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
can do, Doc. It&rsquo;s all over with &rsquo;em. I was there
until quite late. God! It&rsquo;s awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody get out at all?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s a cinch. You see they were
driving back in and feeling for the ledge. Blocking
out, I think. Pretty lean ore, over there, you
know. So there was just one drift away from
the shaft, and it was in that she caved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence and then a half-dozen
questions asked almost in the same moment.
The man turned first to one and then to
another as if striving to decide which query
should be answered first, and shook his head
hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have a chance,&rdquo; he asserted.
&ldquo;It happened three days ago, as you all know.
They sent over to Arrapahoe and all the boys over
there went and volunteered. They worked just
as many men as could get into the drift at a time,
and they spelled each other in half-hour shifts,
so&rsquo;s every man could do his best. They hadn&rsquo;t
got in twenty feet before they saw that she was
bad. Seemed as if the whole drift had been
wiped out. It was as solid as rock in place&ndash;&ndash;just
as if the whole mountain had slipped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go down, Jim?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</p>
<p>For reply the man held up his hands. Dick,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
close behind him and peering forward to see
them in the light that came from a street lamp,
saw they were a mass of blisters with the skin
torn away, red and bleeding. The answer was
too eloquent to require words for the man they
called Jim had evidently been there and striving
madly, as had others, in the attempt to rescue.
There was a surge forward as the crowd pressed
in, each man trying to inspect these evidences of
the tragedy. The questions were coming faster
and from all sides. Most frequently the anxious
demand, coupled with a pronounced eagerness
was, &ldquo;Is there anything any of us can do? Can
we help if we get over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far over is it?&rdquo; Bill asked the man
nearest him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-miles,&rdquo; was the answer. They were all
willing to travel that far, or farther, if they could
be of any assistance whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no use in going,&rdquo; the man in the
center said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more men there now than
can be handled, and all they&rsquo;re doing is to try to
get at the boys&rsquo; bodies. It&rsquo;s sure that they can&rsquo;t
live till they&rsquo;re taken out. You all know that!
They&rsquo;re gone, every one of &rsquo;em. And that ain&rsquo;t
the worst. They left twenty-six widows, most
of &rsquo;em with children!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>A groan went up from the crowd. The word
passed back along like the waves cast up by a rock
thrown into the center of a pool of blackness.
It began at the center with its repetition as the
words were conveyed to those out of earshot.
&ldquo;He says there&rsquo;s twenty-six widows. He says
there&rsquo;s a lot of children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questions were flowing inward again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, boys, there ain&rsquo;t a thing you can do,&rdquo; the
man they called Jim repeated. &ldquo;That is, there
ain&rsquo;t a thing can be done for the boys underground.
They&rsquo;re gone; but somebody ought to
do what can be done for them that&rsquo;s left. It&rsquo;s
money that helps the most. That&rsquo;s the best way
to show that most all of us had friends who went
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and climbed back into his saddle in
the little open space, and there was another moment&rsquo;s
silence. The crowd looked up at him
now, as he sat there in the center of the light
thrown downward, feebly, from the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me room, boys, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;My cayuse is about all in. There ain&rsquo;t nothing
more to tell. There ain&rsquo;t a thing you can do;
but just what I said. Those women and children
will need money. They&rsquo;re all broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd slowly parted and he rode through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
a narrow lane where his stirrups brushed against
those in the front ranks, and then the gathering
began to twist backward and forward, to disintegrate,
to spread itself outward and up the street
of the camp. It talked in a subdued way as it
went. There were but few in it who did not
know and picture the meaning of all that had
been imparted by the courier&ndash;&ndash;the desperate
alarm, the haggard, sobbing women in front of a
hoist, the relays of men who were ready to descend
and beat hammer on steel and tear madly
at slow-yielding rock, the calls for a rest while
carpenters hastily propped up tottering roofs and
walls, the occasional warning shouts when men
fell back to watch other huge masses of rock fall
into the black drift, and the instants when some
rescuer, overwrought, thought he heard sounds
of &ldquo;rock telegraphing&rdquo; and bade the others
pause and listen. There were those among the
men on the street who had seen the desperate,
melancholy conclusions, when hope, flaming ever
more feebly, guttered out as a burned candle and
died. There were those among them who had been in
those black holes of despair and been rescued, to
carry scars of the body for life, but recklessly
forget the scars of the mind, the horrors of despair.
Comparative strangers to the camp as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
were the two men of the Cross, they appreciated
the full meaning of the blow; for doubtless there
was scarcely a man around them who had not
known some of those who perished in that terrible,
lingering agony. Besides they were miners
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty tough luck, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found themselves confronted by the doctor,
who had turned at the sound of their voices
as they resumed conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just learned of it,&rdquo; Dick answered, &ldquo;and
know scarcely anything whatever of it, save what
we just heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been almost the sole topic here for the
last two days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We heard of it after
it was too late for any of us to be of use. I
started over, but got word from a confr&egrave;re of
mine from a camp farther east, that there were
already four doctors on the spot and that I need
not come unless they called for me. Even then
they were hopeless. Most of the men of the
Blackbird were good men, too. The kind that
have families, and are steady; but I suppose
from what I hear they were nearly all fellows
who have been idle for some time, or have just
moved into the district, so probably they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
nothing much to leave in the way of support&ndash;&ndash;for
those left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment and peered at other
men who were passing them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it my duty to do something in that
regard,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;I believe I shall get
Mrs. Meredith to call a meeting out in front of
her place. Nearly every man of the camp goes
there at some time or another, in the course of
the evening. Perhaps I could&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he stopped, as if thinking of the best
plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; interpolated the miner, almost as
his younger companion was about to offer the
same suggestion. &ldquo;Let her send out word that
every man in the camp is wanted. Then you
give them the last news and get them to do what
they can. That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the best way,&rdquo; asserted Dick, agreeing
with the project. &ldquo;You can do more than any
one. They all respect and know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left him to make his way toward the
High Light and stood at the borders of little
gatherings on the street, gleaning other details
of the tragedy, for nearly an hour, and then were
attracted by a sound below them. Men were
calling to one another. Out in front of the High
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Light two torches flared, their flames glowing
steadily in the still night air and lighting the
faces of those who gathered toward them. They
went with the street current and again found
themselves in a crowd; but it was not so dense as
that first one they had encountered. Men stood
in groups, thoughtfully, with hands in pockets,
their harsh, strong faces rendered soft by the
light. They talked together with a quiet and
sad sympathy, as if in that hour they were all
of one family up there in the heart of the mountains
from which they tore their hard livelihood.
There was a stir from the nearest store and a
voice called, &ldquo;Here, Doc! Here&rsquo;s a couple of
boxes for you to stand on so they can see you
when you talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men were carrying some large packing cases,
or tumbling them end over end, with hollow,
booming noises, to form a crude platform. The
boxes clashed together. Two men holding the
torches climbed up on them and they saw two
others boosting the doctor upward. At sight of
him there was a restraining hiss passed round
through the gathering crowd, commanding silence.
He waited for it to become complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have all heard the
news. Thirty-three of our fellows died over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
across the divide, or are dying now. God knows
which! God grant they went quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and although not a trained orator,
the pause could have been no more effective. Dick
looked around him. The faces of those nearest
were grave and unmoved, as if carved from the
mother rock of the country in which they delved;
but he saw a light in their frowning eyes that
told how deeply their sympathies were stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get up here to talk to you so much
about them, however,&rdquo; the doctor went on,
quietly, &ldquo;as I did to remind you that out of thirty-three
of these men there were twenty-six who left
widows, or widows and children behind them.
The boys over there did all they could. There
were a hundred and fifty men who tried to save
them. They are now working merely to get their
bodies. We couldn&rsquo;t be there to help in that; so
we do what we can here. And that doing shall
consist in helping out those women and children.
There&rsquo;s a box down here in front of me. I wish
you&rsquo;d put what you can on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill, staring over the heads of those around
him, saw a movement among those nearest the
orator&rsquo;s stand, and into the ring of light stepped
The Lily. Apparently she was speaking to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
doctor, who leaned down to listen. He straightened
up and called for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Meredith,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;says that any
man here who has no money with him can sign
what he wants to give on a piece of paper, and
that she will accept it as she would a pay-check
and forward the cash. Then on pay-day the man
can come and redeem his paper pledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a low murmur of approval swept
round over the crowd which began to move forward
with slow regularity. The doctor dropped
down from his rostrum as if his task were done.
The torches lowered as their bearers followed
him and planted them beside the box on which
coins, big round silver dollars and yellow gold-pieces,
were falling, with here and there a scrap
of paper. No one stood guard over that collection.
The crowd was thinning out. Dick
turned toward his friend and looked up at him
to meet eyes as troubled as his own. Each
understood the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had some money of my own,&rdquo; the
younger man exclaimed; &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t a dollar
that actually belongs to me. I am going to borrow
a little from Sloan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that much,&rdquo; was the sorrowful
reply. &ldquo;And there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d rather do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
in the world than walk up there and drop a couple
of hundred on that pile. I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner indicated that he was about to
relapse into stronger terms. He suddenly
whirled. A hand had been laid on his sleeve and
a low, steady voice said, &ldquo;Excuse me, I heard you
talking and I understand. I know what you feel.
I want you to permit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Meredith who had walked around
behind them unobserved and now held out her
hand. They fell back, embarrassed. She appeared
to fathom their position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t eavesdropping.
I saw you here. I wanted to talk to you
both and so, well, I overheard. Take this, won&rsquo;t
you? Please permit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill suddenly reached his hand out and found
in his palm a roll of bills, rare in that camp. He
looked at them curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is five hundred dollars in it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;That permits a reasonable gift from each of
you. You can return it to me at your convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of them had spoken to her in all this
time. Now both voiced thanks. But a moment
later Dick found himself talking alone and
telling her that he would send her a check within
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
a few days to cover the amount of the loan; but
she was not looking at him. He saw that her
eyes were fixed on the big man by his side, who
stood there looking down into her face. For
some reason she appeared embarrassed by that
direct scrutiny, and her eyes fell, and wandered
around on those standing nearest. Suddenly
she frowned, and wondering they followed the
direction of her look. Not ten feet from them,
standing stockily on his feet with his high, heavy
shoulders squared, his hands thrust deep into his
pockets, his firm face unmoved, his hat shading
his eyes, stood Bully Presby. He made no
movement toward the goal of the contributors,
and seemed to have no intention of so doing. As
if to escape an unpleasant situation The Lily
suddenly walked toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Mister Presby,&rdquo; she saluted,
and he slowly turned his head and stared at her.
He did not shift his attitude in the least, and appeared
granite-like in his rigid pose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you have put
something into the contribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; he replied with his customary
incisive, harsh voice. &ldquo;Why should I? The
contribution means nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brutality, the inhumanity of his words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
made her recoil for an instant, and then she
recovered her fearlessness and dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known that,&rdquo; she said, coolly.
&ldquo;I should have expected nothing more from you.
The lives of these&ndash;&ndash;all these&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and she gestured
toward those around&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;mean nothing to you.
Nor the sufferings and poverties of those dependent
on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he answered with a trace of
a harsh sneer outlined on his face. &ldquo;If they get
killed, I am sorry. If they live, they are useful.
If they are lost, others take their places. They
are merely a part of the general scheme. They
are for me to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were like a challenge. He watched
her curiously as if awaiting her reply. Dick
felt Bill starting forward, angrily, then checked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear what he
has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lily took a step forward to arraign him.
Her face shone whiter than ever in the light of
the torches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is all? That is your attitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer, but stared at her curiously.
It seemed to anger her more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you would care for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
my estimate of you! I wonder if you would
care for the estimate of those around you. It
does not seem strange that you are called by the
fitting sobriquet of &lsquo;Bully Presby.&rsquo; You are
that! You are one of those shriveled souls that
fatten on the toil of others&ndash;&ndash;that thrive on
others&rsquo; misfortunes and miseries. My God! A
usurer&ndash;&ndash;a pawnbroker, is a prince compared to
you. You are without compassion, pity, charity
or grace. Your code is that of winning all, the
code of greed! Listen to me. You doubtless
look down on me as a camp woman, and with a
certain amount of scorn! But knowing what I
am, I should far rather be what I am, the owner
of the High Light, a sordid den, than to be you,
the owner of the Rattler, the man they call Bully
Presby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To their astonishment he leaned his head
back and laughed, deeply, from his chest, as if
her anger, her scorn, her bitter denunciation, had
all served to amuse him. It was as if she had
flattered him by her characterizations. She was
too angry to speak and stood regarding him
coldly until he had finished. He turned and appeared
for the first time to observe the men of
the Croix d&rsquo;Or scowling at him, and his laugh
abruptly stopped. He scowled back at them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
and, without so much as a good-night salutation
turned and walked away and lost himself in the
shadows of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, facing them and clenching her
hands, &ldquo;sometimes I hate that man! He is unfathomable!
There have been times when I
wondered if he was human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bit her lip as if to restrain her words, and
then looked up at the partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are times,&rdquo; drawled the big miner,
&ldquo;when I wonder how long I&rsquo;ll be able to keep my
hands off of him. And one of those times has
been in the last minute! If you think it would
do any good, I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him and smiled, for the first
time since they had met. She interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the only way you can do any good is to
make your contribution. I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked together toward the box which
was now deserted, save by the doctor and one
other, who were scooping the money into a water
pail they had secured somewhere. Bill threw his
roll of bills into it and the doctor looked up and
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
that, with the two thousand that Mrs. Meredith
has volunteered&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>She checked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was to be my secret. Please, none of
you, speak of it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;And I
apologize. Now I would suggest that you take
charge of this and take it to the High Light. I&rsquo;ll
send it over to-morrow by Jim. The boys have
done well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all he said, and yet in his simple
sentence was much. The camp had done well.
He straightened up with an air of weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pail is pretty heavy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you take it, Mathews, and carry it over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miner caught it up in his arms, fearing
lest the bail break loose under its weight. The
doctor bade them good night, and they started
toward the High Light, leaving the torch man to
extinguish his flares. She talked freely as she
walked between them, expressing her relief that
none of the destitute in that distant camp of
mourning would suffer unduly after the receipt
of Goldpan&rsquo;s offering. As they entered the house
of the lights and noise the bartender nearest
hailed her, wiped his hands on his apron and
reached out an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully Presby was in here about an hour or
two ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and left this. It was before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
you and Doc Mills was goin&rsquo; out to try and get
the boys interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tore it open, then flushed, and passed it to
the partners who together read it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; the letter read, &ldquo;that some of the
men who were killed over at the Blackbird used
to work for me down in California. Also that
there are some women and children over there
who may have a hard time of it. Will you see
to it that this goes to the right channels, and regard
it as confidential? I don&rsquo;t want to appear
to be a philanthropist on even a small scale.
Presby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pinned to the letter was a check. It was for
ten thousand dollars. Bill lifted it in his fingers,
scanned each word, then handed it to Mrs.
Meredith who stood frowning with her eyes fixed
on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known burros, and other contrary cusses,
in my time,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;but this feller
Presby has &rsquo;em all lookin&rsquo; as simple, and plain,
and understandable, as a cross-roads guide-post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And The Lily, contrite, agreed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>WHERE A GIRL ADVISES</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing about you, pardner,
I don&rsquo;t quite sabe,&rdquo; drawled Bill to his
employer as they sat in front of their
cabin one night, after discussing the assays which
Dick made his especial work. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t as
talkative as you used to be. Somethin&rsquo;s on
your mind. It&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n two weeks now since I
had time to think about anything but the green
lead, and I&rsquo;m beginnin&rsquo; to notice. Where the
devil do you go every mornin&rsquo; between nine and
eleven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned toward him impulsively, and then
made no reply, other than to laugh softly. Then
slowly he felt a wave of embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that it&rsquo;s any of my business, bein&rsquo; as
you&rsquo;re you and I&rsquo;m me; but we were pardners
for some years before things changed and made
you the boss and me the hired hand. And it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
may be I&rsquo;m undue curious. Who&rsquo;s that girl you
go up on the pipe line to meet every mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His question was so abrupt that, for an instant,
the younger man had a hot, childish anger;
but he controlled himself, and wondered why he
should have been annoyed by the frank interrogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Presby, the lumberman&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he
said crisply. &ldquo;But what interests me most is
how you knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder miner slapped his leg gleefully, as
if pleased with a joke, and said: &ldquo;Well, I
went up there five or six days ago, tryin&rsquo; to find
you, because I&rsquo;d lost the combination to the safe,
and wanted to look over them old drawings. I
sneaked back, because I was a little jealous to see
you sittin&rsquo; on the pipe talkin&rsquo; right friendly
to such a good-looker. Three evenin&rsquo;s later
while you were workin&rsquo; on them mill samples,
I thought I&rsquo;d like to see the whole of
the line. I took a walk. There&rsquo;s been a
real good horse trail worked into the ground
up there, ain&rsquo;t there? And it&rsquo;s a new trail,
too. Seems as if somebody must have been
riding up and down that way every day for just
about two weeks. And it&rsquo;s serious, too, because
you don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; to a man you was pardners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
with for more&rsquo;n seven years. Hey, Dick! What
ails you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger man was on his feet with one of
his fists drawn back, in an attitude of extreme
temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose after this you mind your own
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full half minute the elder man sat there
in the dusk, and then said slowly: &ldquo;All right,
boy&ndash;&ndash;I mean, Mister Townsend&ndash;&ndash;I will hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the gloom his figure seemed suddenly bent
forward more than usual, and his voice had a
note of terrible hurt. It was as if all the ties of
seven years of vicissitude had been arbitrarily
cast off by his old partner; that they had become
master and man. His words conveyed an indescribable
sorrow, and loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s arm had relaxed, and he had stepped
closer. Mathews did not lift his head. A
hand, pleading, fell on his shoulder, and rested
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, I didn&rsquo;t mean it! I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;well, I&rsquo;m
upset. Something&rsquo;s happened to me. I didn&rsquo;t
seem to realize it till just now. I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;well, thank
you, I&rsquo;m making a fool of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>The faithful gray head lifted itself, and the
gray eyes glowed warmly as they peered in the
dusk at the younger man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whe-e-w!&rdquo; he whistled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as bad as
that, is it, boy? Just forget it, won&rsquo;t you? That
is, forget I butted in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick sat down, hating himself for such an unusual
outburst. He felt foolish, and extremely
young again, as if his steadfast foundations of
self-reliance and repression had been proven
nothing more than sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how them things go,&rdquo; the slow voice,
so soft as to be scarcely audible, continued. &ldquo;I
was young once, and it was good to be young.
Not that I&rsquo;m old now, because I&rsquo;m not; but because
when a feller is younger, there are hot
hollows in his heart that he don&rsquo;t want anybody
to know about. Only don&rsquo;t make me feel again
that I ought to &lsquo;mister&rsquo; you. I don&rsquo;t believe I
could do that. It&rsquo;s pretty late to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick went to his bed with a critical admission
of the truth, and from any angle it appeared
foolish. How had it all happened? He was
not prone to be easy of heart. He had known
the light, fleeting loves of boyhood, and could
laugh at them; but they had been different to this.
And it had come on him at a time when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
everything was at stake, and when his undivided
thoughts and attention should have been centered
on the Croix d&rsquo;Or. He reviewed his situation,
and scarcely knew why he had drifted into it,
unless it had been through a desire to talk to some
one who knew, as he knew, all that old life from
which he had been, and would forever be, parted.</p>
<p>Not that he regretted its easy scramble, and its
plethora of civilized concomitants; for he loved
the mountains, the streams, the open forests, and
the physical struggles of the wild places; but&ndash;&ndash;and
he gave over reasoning, and knew that it was
because of the charm of Miss Presby herself,
and that he wanted her, and had hoped unconsciously.
Sternly arraigning himself, he knew
that he had no groundwork to hope, and nothing
to offer, just then; that he must first win with the
Croix d&rsquo;Or, and that it was his first duty to win
with that, and justify the confidence of the kindly
old Sloan who backed him with hard dollars.</p>
<p>He had not appreciated how much the daily
meeting of Miss Presby meant to him until, on
the following morning, and acting on his hardly
reached resolution of the night before, he went
up for what might be the last time. It was difficult
to realize that the short summer of the altitudes
was there in its splendid growth, and that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
it had opened before his unobserving eyes, passed
from the tender green of spring to the deep-shaded
depths of maturity, and that the wild
flowers that carpeted the open slopes had made
way for roses. Even the cross on the peak was
different, and it came to him that he had not
observed it in the weeks he had been climbing to
the slope, but had always waited eagerly for the
light of a woman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>She came cantering up the trail, and waved a
gay hand at him as she rounded the bend of the
crag. There was a frank expectancy in her face&ndash;&ndash;the
expectancy of a pleasant hour&rsquo;s visit with
a good comrade. He wondered, vaguely and
with new scrutiny, if that were not all&ndash;&ndash;just
friendliness. They talked of nothing; but his
usual bantering tone was gone, and, quick to
observe, she divined that there had come to him
a subtle change, not without perturbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem talkative to-day,&rdquo; she accused
as he stood up, preparatory to going.
&ldquo;Have you finished work on your pipe line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flushed slightly under the bronze of his
face at the question, it being thus brought home
to him that he had used it as a pretext for continuing
their meetings for more than two weeks
after that task was completed and the pipemen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
scattered&ndash;&ndash;perhaps working in some subway in
New York by that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the work is finished. I shall
not come up here again unless it is for the sole
purpose of seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in his tone that caused
her to glance up at him and there was that in his
eyes, on his face, in his bearing of restraint, that
caused her to look around again, as if to escape,
and hastily begin donning her gloves. She pulled
the fingers, though they fitted loosely, as if she
had difficulty with them&ndash;&ndash;even as though they
were tight gloves of kid, and said: &ldquo;Well, you
might do that, sometimes&ndash;&ndash;when you have time;
but you mustn&rsquo;t neglect your work. I come here
because it is my favorite ride. You must not
come merely to talk to me when there are other
duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, endeavoring to appear unconcerned.
&ldquo;The Croix d&rsquo;Or is apt to be a most
insistent tyrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it should come first!&rdquo; He was obtuse
for the instant in his worriment, and did not
catch the subtle shade of bitterness in which she
spoke.</p>
<p>She tugged at the reins of her horse, and the
animal reluctantly tore loose a last mouthful of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
the succulent grass growing under the moisture
and shadow of the big steel pipe, and stood expectantly
waiting for her to mount. She was in
the saddle before Dick could come around to her
side to assist her. He made a last desperate
compromise, finding an excuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I feel that I must see you, because
you are such a good little adviser, I shall come
back here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;morning after morning,
in the hope of seeing you and unburdening my
disgruntlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, as if it were a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not a very good miner,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;although I suppose I ought to be a yellow-legged
expert, having been brought up somewhere
within sound of the stamps all my life. Good
luck to you. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His reply was almost a mumble, and the black
horse started down the trail. He watched her,
with a sinking, hungry heart. Just as the crag
was almost abreast of her mount, she turned and
called back: &ldquo;Oh, I forgot to say that I shall
probably come here almost every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not understand, until long afterward,
the effort that speech cost her; nor did he know
ever that her face was suffused when her horse,
startled, sprang out of sight at the touch of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
spurs. He did not know, as he stood there,
wishing that he had called her back, that she was
riding recklessly down the road, hurt, and yet
inclined to be strangely happy over that parting
and all it had confessed. With a set face, as if
a whole fabric of dreams had been wrenched
from his life, the miner turned and walked
slowly over the trail, worn by his own feet, which
led him back to the Croix d&rsquo;Or, and the struggle
with the stubborn rock.</p>
<p>As he topped the hill he suddenly listened, and
his steps quickened. From below a new sound
had been added to the threnody of the hills; a
new note, grumbling and roaring, insistent and
strong. Its message was plain. The mill of
the Cross was running again for the first time in
years; and, even as he looked down on the red
roof, the whistle in the engine-house gave a series
of cheerful toots in salute of the fact.</p>
<p>Down on the flat in front of the long structure
which held, in its batteries, almost two-score
stamps, a tall figure came out, and looked around
as if seeking him, and then, casting its eyes upward,
beheld him, and lifted a battered hat and
swung it overhead. It was Bill, rejoicing in his
work.</p>
<p>A car of ore slid along the tramway, with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
carboy dangling one leg over the back end while
steadying himself by the controller, as if he had
been thus occupied for years. Dick tore his hat
off, threw it in the air, and shouted, and raced
down the hill. From now on it must be work;
unless they met with great success&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;he
dared not stop to think of what then.</p>
<p>He hastened on down to the mill and entered
the door. Everything about it, from the dumping
of the cars sixty feet above, the wrench of
the crushers breaking the ore into smaller fragments,
the clash of the screens as it came on
down to the stamps, and their terrific &ldquo;jiggety-jig-jig,&rdquo;
roared, throbbed, and trembled. Every
timber in the structure seemed to keep pace with
that resistless shaking as the tables slid to and
fro, dripping from the water percolating at their
heads, to distribute the fine silt of crushed,
muddy ore evenly over the plates in the steady
downward slant. Already the bright plates of
copper, coated with quicksilver, were catching,
retaining, amalgamating the gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The venners need a little more slant, don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo; bellowed his partner, with his
hands cupped and held close against Dick&rsquo;s ear
in the effort to make himself heard in that pandemonium
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
where millmen worked the shift
through without attempting to speak.</p>
<p>In the critical calculation of the professional
miner, Dick forgot all other affairs, and leaned
down to see the run of water. He nodded his
head, beckoned to the mill boss, and by well-known
signs indicated his wish. He scrambled
above and studied the pulp, slipping it through
his fingers and feeling its fineness, and speculating
whether or not they would be troubled with
any solution of lead that would render the milling
difficult and slime the plates so that the gold
would escape to go roistering down the creek
with waste water. It did feel very slippery, and
he was reassured. He was eager to get to the
assay-house and make his first assay of &ldquo;tailings,&rdquo;
refuse from the mill, to discover what
percentage of gold they were saving, and, in parlance,
&ldquo;How she would run on mill test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fascinated in his inspection and direction of
certain minor changes, he was astonished when
the noise suddenly dropped from fortissimo to
a dull whine, as the mill slowed down to a stop
for the noon hour. And the afternoon passed
as quickly while he worked over the bucking
board&ndash;&ndash;a plate used to crush ore for assaying&ndash;&ndash;in
the assay-house, and watched the gasoline
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
flare and fume in his furnaces to bring the little
cupels, with their mass of powdered, weighed,
and numbered samples, to a molten state. He
took them out with his tongs, watched them cool,
and weighed, on the scales that could tell the
weight of a lead pencil mark on a sheet of paper,
the residue of gold, thus making his computations.
He was not pleased with the result. The
green lead was not as rich as they had believed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t pay more than fifty cents a ton
with the best milling we can do,&rdquo; he said to
Bill, who came eagerly into the assay office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know the old idea&ndash;&ndash;that she gets
richer as we go down?&rdquo; his partner asserted.
&ldquo;If it pays fifty cents a ton at the mill plates,
we&rsquo;ll open up the face of the ledge and put on a
day and night shift. We can handle a heap of
ore with this plant. It begins to look to me as
if the Cross is all to the good. Come on. Let&rsquo;s
go down to the power-house and see how things
look down there when we&rsquo;re working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been contemplating a new timber
road, and, after visiting the power plant and
finding it trim, and throbbing with its new life,
they cut across and debouched into the public
road leading up the ca&ntilde;on, by the banks of the
stream, to the Rattler. When almost at the fork,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
where their own road branched off and crossed
the stream to begin its steep little climb up to
the Croix d&rsquo;Or, they saw a man standing on the
apron of the bridge, and apparently listening to
the roar of their mill. His back was toward
them, and seemingly he was so absorbed in the
sounds of industry from above that he did not
hear them approach until their feet struck the
first planks leading to the heavy log structure.
He turned his head slowly toward them, and
they recognized him as Bully Presby. It was
the first time either of them had seen him since
the evening in the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re running, eh?&rdquo; he asked Dick without
any preliminary courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we started the mill to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On ore, or waste?&rdquo; There was a sneer in
his question which caused Dick to stiffen a trifle;
and Bill frowned, as if the question carried an
insult.</p>
<p>Still the younger man was inclined to avoid
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, we shouldn&rsquo;t put waste through
the mill,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;We have opened up
an old vein which the other managers did not
seem to think worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, I suppose, showing superior
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
knowledge, you will demonstrate that the men before
you were a set of dubs? Humph! From babes
and fools come wisdom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was hard and cynical, and his grim
lips curled with a slightly contemptuous twitch.
The hot, impulsive streak in Dick leaped upward.
His eyes were angry when he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you apply the latter to me,&rdquo; he retorted
hotly, &ldquo;you are going pretty far. I don&rsquo;t know
what business it is of yours. We have never
asked you for any advice, and we don&rsquo;t want
any. I expect no favors from any one, and if I
did, am certain, in view of your attitude, that I
shouldn&rsquo;t ask them from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady! Steady, boy!&rdquo; admonished his
partner&rsquo;s drawling voice at his side. Dick did
not utter other words that were surging to his
tongue, and finished with an angry shrug of his
shoulders.</p>
<p>Bill turned coolly to the owner of the Rattler,
and appeared to probe him with his eyes; and
his stare was returned with one as searching as
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Presby asked, as if the big
miner were some man he had not noticed before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? My name&rsquo;s Mathews. I&rsquo;m superintendent
of the Croix d&rsquo;Or,&rdquo; Bill answered, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
calmly as if the form of question had been ignored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose the young Mister Townsend
relies on you for advice, and that he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t need to rely on any one for advice,&rdquo;
interrupted the soft, repressed voice. &ldquo;I
rely on him. He knows more than I do. And
say,&rdquo; he added, taking a step toward Bully
Presby, and suddenly appearing to concentrate
himself with all his muscles flexed as if for action,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve mined for thirty-five years. And I&rsquo;ve met
some miners. And I&rsquo;ve never met one who had
as little decency for the men on the next claim,
or such bullying ways as you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presby&rsquo;s face did not change in the least, nor
did he shift his eyes. There was an instant&rsquo;s
pause, and he showed no inclination to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Most every one around these diggings
seems to be kind of buffaloed by you,&rdquo; Bill added;
&ldquo;but I sort of reckon we ain&rsquo;t like them. I&rsquo;m
handin&rsquo; it to you right straight, so you and me
won&rsquo;t have any trouble after this, because if we
do&ndash;&ndash;well, we&rsquo;d have to find out which was the
better man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bully Presby&rsquo;s eyes flashed a singular look.
It seemed as if they carried something of approval,
and at the same time a longing to test
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the question of physical superiority. And then,
abruptly, he laughed. Astonished by this
strange, complex character, Bill relaxed, and
turned toward his partner. Dick, seeing that the
interview was ended, as far as the necessity for
saying anything was concerned, moved across
the bridge, and Bill took a last hard stare at the
mine owner. The latter laughed again, with
his cold, cynical rumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that when the Cross
shuts down for good, I&rsquo;d like to give you a job.
When it does, come and see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another look, word, or sign of interest,
he turned his back on them, and marched up
the hill toward the Rattler.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>TROUBLE STALKS ABROAD</h3>
</div>
<p>August had come, with its broiling heat
at midday and its chill at night, when
the snow, perpetual on the peaks, sent
its cold breezes downward to the gulches below.
Here and there the grass was dying. The lines
on Dick&rsquo;s brows had become visible; and even
Mathews&rsquo; resolute sanguinity was being tested
to the utmost. The green lead was barely paying
expenses. There had come no justification
for a night shift, and use of all the batteries of
the mill, for the ledge of ore was gradually, but
certainly, narrowing to a point where it must
eventually pinch out.</p>
<p>Five times, in as many weeks, Dick had
crossed the hill and waited for Miss Presby.
Twice he had been bitterly disappointed, and
three times she had cantered around to meet him.
Their first meeting had been constrained. He
felt that it was due to his own bald discovery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
that he wanted her more than anything in life,
and was debarred from telling her so. In the
second meeting she had been the good comrade,
and interested, palpably, in the developments at
the Croix d&rsquo;Or.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should sink, I believe,&rdquo; she had said
hesitatingly, as if with a delicate fear that she
was usurping his position. &ldquo;I know this district
very well, indeed; and there isn&rsquo;t a mine along
this range that has paid until it had gone the
depth. Do I talk like a miner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, in cheerful carelessness as if his
worries meant but little to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve heard so much of mines and
mining, although my father seldom talks of them
to me, that I know the geological formation and
history of this district like a real miner. I played
with nothing but miners&rsquo; children from the time
I was so high, pigtails and pinafores, until I was
this high, short skirts and frocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She indicated the progressive stages of her
growth with her riding crop, as if seeing herself
in those younger years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my father sent me to an aunt, in New
York, with instructions that I was to be taught
something, and to be a lady. I believe I used to
eat with my knife when I first went to her home.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>She leaned back and laughed until the tears
welled into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a Spartan lady. She cured me of it
by rapping my knuckles with the handle of a silver-plated
knife. My, how it hurt! I feel it yet!
I wonder that they were not enlarged by her repeated
admonitions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked at them as she held them reminiscently
before her, and had an almost irresistible
desire to seize and crush the long, slender,
white fingers in his own. But the end of the meeting
had been commonplace, and they had parted
again without treading on embarrassing ground.</p>
<p>Dick had heard no more from the owner of
the Rattler, save indirectly, nor met him since the
strained passage of the bridge; but mess-house
gossip, creeping through old Bells, who recognized
no superiors, and calmly clumped into the
owner&rsquo;s quarters whenever he felt inclined, said
that the neighboring mine was prodigiously prosperous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard down in Goldpan,&rdquo; he squeaked one
night, &ldquo;that Wells Fargo takes out five or six
bars of bullion for him every mill clean-up. And
you can bet none of it ever gets away from that
old stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does this news leak out?&rdquo; Dick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
asked, wondering at such a tale, when millmen
and miners were distinguished for keeping inviolate
the secrets of the property on which they
worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wells Fargo,&rdquo; the engineer answered.
&ldquo;None of the boys would say anything. He pays
top wages and hires good men. Got to hand that
to him. He brags there ain&rsquo;t no man so high-priced
that he can&rsquo;t make money off&rsquo;n him&ndash;&ndash;Bully
Presby does. And they ain&rsquo;t no better miner
than him on earth. He can smell pay ore a mile
underground&ndash;&ndash;Bully Presby can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man suddenly looked at the superintendent,
and said: &ldquo;Say, Bill. You been down
to the camp a few times, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve been down there several times.
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you know they&rsquo;s a lot of
talk goin&rsquo; around that the Cross is workin&rsquo; in
good pay now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve heard it; but don&rsquo;t pay any attention
when it&rsquo;s not so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bells Park leaned farther over, and lowered
his shrill, garrulous voice to a thin murmur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I cain&rsquo;t tell you what it is, but I want
to give you the right lead. When that gets to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
goin&rsquo; on about newcomers in the Blue Mountains&ndash;&ndash;fellers
like you be&ndash;&ndash;look out for storms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! You&rsquo;re full of stuff again!&rdquo; Bill
gibed, with his hearty laugh. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;d listened
to all the mysterious warnin&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve handed us
since we came up here, Bells, we&rsquo;d been like a
dog chasin&rsquo; his tail around when it happened to
be bit off down to the rump and no place to get
hold of. Better look out! Humph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old engineer got up in one of his tantrums,
fairly screamed with rage, threatened to
leave as soon as he could get another job, and
then tramped down the hill to the cabin he occupied
with the other engineer. But that was
not new, either, for he had made the same threat
at least a half-dozen times, and yet the men from
the C&oelig;ur d&rsquo;Alenes knew that nothing could drive
him away but dismissal.</p>
<p>It was but two or three days later that the
partners, coming from the assay-house to the
mess late, discovered a stranger talking to the
men outside under the shade of a great clump of
tamaracks that nestled at the foot of a slope.
They passed in and sat down at their table, wondering
who the visitor could be. The cook&rsquo;s
helper, a mute, served them, and they were alone
when they were attracted by a shrill, soft hiss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
from the window. They looked, and saw Bells
Park. Nothing but his head, cap-crowned, was
visible as he stood on tiptoe to reach the
opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you to look out,&rdquo; he said warningly.
&ldquo;Old Mister Trouble&rsquo;s come. Don&rsquo;t give anything.
Stand pat. A walkin&rsquo; delegate from
Denver&rsquo;s here. God knows why. Look out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His head disappeared as if it were a jack-in-the-box,
shut down; and the partners paused
with anxious eyes and waited for him to reappear.
Dick jumped to his feet and walked across to the
window. No one was in sight. He went to the
farther end of the mess-house and peered through
a corner of the nearest pane. Out under the
tamaracks the stranger was orating, and punctuating
his remarks with a finger tapping in a palm.
His words were not audible; but Dick saw that
he was at least receiving attention. He returned
to the table, and told Bill what he had seen. The
latter was perturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we were goin&rsquo; to have an argument,
don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked, voicing his perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But about what?&rdquo; Dick insisted. &ldquo;We pay
the union scale, and, while I don&rsquo;t know, I believe
there isn&rsquo;t a man on the Cross that hasn&rsquo;t a
card.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied his partner, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon see.
Finished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked to the office, men began to
hurry across the gulch toward the hoist, others
toward the mill, and by the time they were in
their cabin the whistle blew. It was but a minute
later that they heard someone striding over the
porch, and the man they assumed to be the walking
delegate entered. He was not of the usual
stamp, but appeared intent on his errand. Save
for a certain air of craftiness, he was representative
and intelligent. He was quietly dressed,
and gave the distinct impression that he had
come up from the mines, and had known a hammer
and drill&ndash;&ndash;a typical &ldquo;hard-rock man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am representing the
Consolidated Miners&rsquo; Association.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew a neat card from a leather case in
his pocket, and presented it, and was asked to
seat himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do for you?&rdquo; Dick asked,
wasting no time on words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this mine is fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It is straight, as far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has no agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are ready to sign one whenever it is
presented.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>The delegate drew a worn wallet from his
pocket, extracted a paper, and tendered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I anticipated no trouble,&rdquo; he said, but without
smiling or giving any sign of satisfaction.
&ldquo;Would you mind looking that over, and seeing
if it meets with your approval?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick stepped to the high desk at the side of
the room which he had been utilizing as a drawing
board, laid the sheet out, and began reading
it, while Bill stood up and scanned it across his
shoulders. Bill suddenly put a stubby finger on
a clause, and mumbled: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick slowly read it; and, before he had completed
the involved wording, the finger again
clapped down at another section. &ldquo;Nor that.
Don&rsquo;t stand for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, anyhow?&rdquo; Bill demanded,
swinging round and facing the delegate.</p>
<p>The latter looked at him coolly and exasperatingly
for a moment, then said: &ldquo;What position
do you occupy here, my man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick whirled as if he had been struck from
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What position does he occupy? He is my
superintendent, and my friend. Anything he
objects to, or sanctions, I object to, or agree with.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Anything he says, I&rsquo;ll back up. Now I&rsquo;ll let him
do the talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The delegate calmly flicked the ash from a
cigar he had lighted, puffed at it, blew the smoke
from under his mustache toward the ceiling, and
looked at the thin cloud before answering. It
was as if he had come intent on creating a disturbance
through studied insolence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, without noticing the hot, antagonistic
attitude of the mine owner, &ldquo;what do
you think of the proffered agreement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s no good!&rdquo; answered Mathews,
facing him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s drawn up on a number-one
scale. This mine ain&rsquo;t in that class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So you&rsquo;ve signed &rsquo;em before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. A dozen times. This mine has but
one shift&ndash;&ndash;the regular day shift. It has but one
engineer and a helper. It has but one mill boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working eight batteries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You know we couldn&rsquo;t work eight batteries
with one small shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got to have an assistant millman
at the union scale, you know,&rdquo; insisted the
delegate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What to do? To loaf around, I suppose,&rdquo;
Bill retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got to have a turn up in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
engine-house. You need another hoisting engineer,&rdquo;
continued the delegate, as if all these
matters had been decided by him beforehand.</p>
<p>Dick thought that he might gain a more
friendly footing by taking part in the conversation
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Croix d&rsquo;Or isn&rsquo;t
paying interest. Maybe we aren&rsquo;t using the requisite
number of men as demanded under this
rating; but they are all satisfied, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; interrupted the
delegate, with an air of insolent assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we can&rsquo;t go on under the present conditions,
we may as well shut down,&rdquo; Dick concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to you,&rdquo; declared the delegate,
with an air of disinterest. &ldquo;If a mine can&rsquo;t pay
for the working, it ought to shut down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners looked at each other. There
was a mutual question as to whether it would be
policy to throw the delegate out of the door.
Plainly they were in a predicament, for the man
was master, in his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Bill said, accepting the responsibility,
&ldquo;this ain&rsquo;t right. You know it ain&rsquo;t.
We&rsquo;re in another class altogether. You ought
to put us, at present, under&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is right,&rdquo; belligerently asserted the delegate.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked it all over. You&rsquo;ll agree to
it, or I&rsquo;ll declare the Croix d&rsquo;Or unfair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had arisen to his feet as if arbitrarily to
end the argument. For a wonder, the veteran
miner restrained himself, although there was a
hard, glowing light in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t stand for it,&rdquo; he said, restraining
Dick with his elbow. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re ready to
talk on a square basis, come back, and we&rsquo;ll use
the ink. Until then we won&rsquo;t. We might as well
shut down, first as last, as to lose money when
we&rsquo;re just breakin&rsquo; even as it is. Think it over a
while, and see if we ain&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll hear from me,&rdquo; declared the
delegate, as he put his hat on his head and turned
out of the door without any parting courtesy.
&ldquo;Keep the card. My name&rsquo;s Thompson, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full minute after he had gone, the partners
stared at each other with troubled faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a bluff! That&rsquo;s all there is to it,&rdquo;
asserted Mathews, reaching into the corner for
his rubber boots, preparatory to going underground.
&ldquo;He knows it ain&rsquo;t right, just as well
as I do. If he can put this over, all right. If he
can&rsquo;t he&rsquo;ll give us the other rating.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>He left Dick making up a time-roll, and turned
down the hill; and they did not discuss it again
until they were alone that night.</p>
<p>It was seven o&rsquo;clock the next evening when
the partners observed an unusual stir in the
camp. They came into the mess-house to find
that the men had eaten in unusually short order;
and from the bench outside, usually filled at that
hour with laughing loungers, there was not a
sound. A strange stillness had invaded the colony
of the Croix d&rsquo;Or, almost ominous. Preoccupied,
and each thinking over his individual
trials, the partners ate their food and arose from
the table. Out on the doorstep they paused to
look down the ca&ntilde;on, now shorn of ugliness and
rendered beautiful by the purple twilight. The
faint haze of smoke from the banked fires, rising
above the steel chimney of the boiler-house, was
the only stirring, living spectacle visible; save
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Bill drawled, as
if speaking to himself.</p>
<p>Far below, just turning the bend of the road,
Dick saw a procession of men, grouped, or walking
in pairs. They disappeared before he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the boys,&rdquo; he said, using the term
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
of the camps for all men employed. &ldquo;I wonder
where they are bound for? If it were pay night,
I could understand. It would mean Goldpan, the
dance halls, a fight or two, and sore heads to-morrow;
but to-night&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill did not answer. He seemed to be in a
silent, contemplative mood when they sat in the
rough easy-chairs on the porch in front of the
office and looked up at the first rays of light on
the splendid, rugged peak above. Dick&rsquo;s mind
reverted to the lumberman&rsquo;s daughter, as does
the needle veer to the magnet; and for a long
time they sat there, until the fires of their cigars
glowed like stars. The moon came up, and the
cross was outlined, dimly, above them, and
against the background of black, cast upon the
somber, starlit blue of the night.</p>
<p>From far below, as if steel had been struck
upon stone, came a faint, ringing sound. Living
in that strange world of acuteness to which men
of the high hills are habituated, they listened,
alert. Accustomed, as are all those dwellers of
the lonesome spots, to heeding anything out of
the ordinary, they strained their ears for a repetition.
Clattering up the roadway came the
sound of a hard-ridden horse&rsquo;s hoofs, then his
labored breathing, and a soft voice steadying him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
to further effort. Into the shadows was injected
something moving, some unfamiliar, living shape.
It turned up the hill over the trail, and plunged
wearily toward them. They jumped to their feet
and stepped down off the porch, advancing to
meet the belated visitor. The horse, with lathering
neck and distended nostrils, paused before
them. The moon cleared the top of the eastern
ridges with a slow bound, lowering the shadows
until the sweat on the horse&rsquo;s neck glistened like
a network of diamond dust strewn on a velvet
cloak. It also lighted to a pallid gleam the still
face of the night rider. It was Lily Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying
to make trouble for you, down there in the
camp. Bells Park came out and told me about
it. The miners&rsquo; union stirred up by that man
from Denver. Bells said the only chance you
had was to come down there at once. They&rsquo;ve
split on your account&ndash;&ndash;on account of the Croix
d&rsquo;Or. I&rsquo;ve ridden two miles to warn you, and to
get you there before the meeting breaks up. Bells
will try and hold them until you can come and
demand a hearing. If you don&rsquo;t make it they
will scab the mine. You must hurry. It&rsquo;s your
only chance. I know them, the best friends in
peace, and devils when turned the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>She stopped abruptly and looked off at the
moon, and then around over the dark and silent
camp. Only one light was visible, that in the
cook&rsquo;s end of the mess-house, where that fat
worthy lay upon his back and read a yellow-backed,
sentimental novel. Faint and rumbling
came the subdued roar of the mill at the Rattler,
beating out the gold for Bully Presby; and
through some vague prescience Dick was aware
of its noise for the first time in weeks, and it
conveyed a sense of menace. Everything was at
stake. Everything watched him. He looked up
at the white face of The Lily above him, and in
the moonlight saw that her eyes were fixed, glowing,
not on him or the scenes of the night, but on
the aroused giant at his side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>BELLS&rsquo; VALIANT FIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get there as soon as we can,&rdquo;
Dick said. &ldquo;It may not do any
good; but we&rsquo;ll demand a word
and give them an argument. I haven&rsquo;t time to
thank you now, Mrs. Meredith, but some day&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You owe me no thanks,&rdquo; was her rejoinder.
&ldquo;It is I who owe you. Turn about, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man said nothing, but took a step
nearer to her horse, and looked up into her face
with his penetrating eyes. He reached up and
closed his hand over both of hers, and held them
for an instant, and then whirled back into the
cabin to get his hat. The horse pivoted and
started away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I see Bells before you do,&rdquo; a voice floated
up from the shadows below, where the moon had
not yet penetrated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re coming.
So long.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>As the partners dog-trotted down the trail,
she was already a long way in advance. Now
and then, as they panted up the steep path leading
away behind the Rattler, whose lights glowed
dimly, they heard faint sounds telling them that
she was hastening back to Goldpan. The winding
of the trail took them away from the immediate
roar of the stamp mill behind, and they
were still in the gloom, when they saw the horse
and rider outlined for a moment high above them
on the crest of the divide and they thought she
stopped for a moment and looked back. Then
the silhouette seemed to float down out of sight,
and was gone.</p>
<p>At the top, wordless, and sweating with effort,
they filled their lungs, hitched their belts tighter,
and plunged into the shadows leading toward
the straggling rows of lights far below. They
ran now, doggedly, hoping to arrive in the camp
before the meeting came to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we want,&rdquo; Bill said jerkily, as his feet
pounded on the last decline, &ldquo;is a chance to argue
it out with the men themselves before this Denver
feller gets his work in. I&rsquo;m entitled to talk
to &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve got my own card, and am as good
a union man as any of &rsquo;em. The boys&rsquo;ll be reasonable
if they stop to think.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>They hastened up the roadway of the street,
which was, as at any hour of the night, filled with
moving men and clamorous with sound. They
knew that the miners&rsquo; hall was at its farthest end
over the Golden Age Saloon, and so lost no
time in directing their steps toward it. A group
in the roadway compelled them to turn out; and
they were hurrying past, when a high, angry
voice arrested them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what they did to me&ndash;&ndash;me, old
Bells Park, who is sixty-four!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned into the crowd, followed by his
partner, and began forcing his way through.
Bells was screaming and sobbing now in anger,
and venting a tirade of oaths. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been
younger they couldn&rsquo;t have done it so easily. If
I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; had my gun, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; killed some of &rsquo;em, I
would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the partners gained the little opening
around him, the light from a window disclosed
the white-headed, little man. Two men were half-holding
him up. His face was a mass of blood,
which one of his supporters was endeavoring to
wipe away with a handkerchief, and from all
sides came indignant, sympathetic mutterings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did that?&rdquo; roared the heavy, infuriated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
voice of Bill as he turned to those around
him.</p>
<p>Bells, whose eyes were swollen shut, recognized
the voice, and lurched forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fellers backin&rsquo; up that Denver thug,&rdquo;
he wailed. &ldquo;I was tryin&rsquo; to hold &rsquo;em till you
come. He had the meetin&rsquo; packed with a lot of
bums I never saw before, and, when I told &rsquo;em
what I thought of &rsquo;em and him, he ordered me
thrown out. I tore my card to pieces and
chucked &rsquo;em in his fat face, and then one of the
fellers that came with him hit me. They threw
me down the stairs, and might &rsquo;a&rsquo; killed me if
there hadn&rsquo;t been one or two of my friends there.
They call &rsquo;emselves union miners! The dirty
loafers!&rdquo; And his voice screamed away again
into a line of objurgations and anathemas until
Bill quieted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;give us a hand.
We&rsquo;ll take him over to Lily&rsquo;s rooms and have
her get Doc Mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was unusually calm and contained.
Dick had heard him use that tone but once before,
when he made a proposition to a man in an Arizona
camp that the road was wide, the day fine,
and each well armed. He had helped bury the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
other man after that meeting, so now read the
danger note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get The Lily to come up and open the
door,&rdquo; one of Bells&rsquo; supporters said; &ldquo;and won&rsquo;t
you go for Doc?&rdquo; He addressed the man on
the other side of the engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>Within five minutes they were in Mrs. Meredith&rsquo;s
rooms again; and it seemed to Dick, as he
looked around its dainty fittings, that it was forever
to be a place of tragedy; for the memory
of that terribly burned victim of the fire was
still there, and he seemed to see her lying,
scorched and unconscious, on the white counterpane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His nose is busted, I think,&rdquo; his partner said
to The Lily, whose only comment was an abrupt
exclamation: &ldquo;What a shame! The cowards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the woman with his set face,
and, still speaking in that calm, deadly voice,
said: &ldquo;Do you happen to have your gun up
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes opened wider, and Dick was about
to interpose, when she answered understandingly:
&ldquo;Yes; but I&rsquo;ll not give it to you, Bill Mathews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said, as quietly as if his request
or her refusal had been mere desultory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
conversation. &ldquo;I might need one in a pinch; but
if you can&rsquo;t spare it, I reckon the boy and me
can do what we have to do without one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and walked from the room and
Dick followed, hoping to argue him from that
dangerous mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Bill,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it about bad
enough without any more trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re not
with me?&rdquo; exclaimed the miner, suddenly turning
on him and stopping abruptly in the street.
&ldquo;Are you for lettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em get away with it? Of
course you ain&rsquo;t! You always stick. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw that the lights in the miners&rsquo; hall
were out, and began a steady tour of the saloons
in the vicinity. One of their own men was in
one of them&ndash;&ndash;Smuts, the blacksmith, cursing
loudly and volubly as they entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them boys has always treated us white
clean through,&rdquo; he bawled, banging his fist on the
bar, &ldquo;and a lot of you pikers that don&rsquo;t know
nothin&rsquo; about the case sit around like a lot of
yaps and let this Denver bunch pack the meetin&rsquo;
and declare a strike. Then you let the same
Denver bunch jump on poor old Bells, and
hammer him to a pulp after they&rsquo;ve hustled him
out of the door, instead of follerin&rsquo; out to see that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
he don&rsquo;t get the worst of it. Bah! I&rsquo;m dead
sick of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners had paused while listening to
him, and he now saw them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out here, Smuts,&rdquo; Dick said, turning
toward the door, and the smith followed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;ve ordered a strike on us, have
they?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the blacksmith&rsquo;s heated response;
&ldquo;but it don&rsquo;t go for me! I stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you&rsquo;re with us, where is that Denver
bunch?&rdquo; Bill asked; and Dick knew that any
effort to deter his partner from his purpose
would prove useless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all went down to the High Light,&rdquo;
the smith answered. &ldquo;Have you seen Bells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and taken care of him. Now I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
to take care of the man that done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blacksmith banged a heavy hand on the
superintendent&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you! I&rsquo;m with you. We&rsquo;ll go
together!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and at once led the way
toward the flaming lights of the High Light
but a few doors below.</p>
<p>Dick nerved himself for the inevitable, and
grimly walked with them as they entered the
doors. As they stood there, with the big miner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
in front, a sudden hush invaded the babel of
noise, and men began to look in their direction.
The grim, determined man in the lead, glaring
here and there with cold, terrible eyes, was too
noticeable a figure to escape observation. The
set face of his partner, scarcely less determined,
and the smith, with brawny, clenched hands, and
bushy, black brows drawn into a fierce scowl,
completed the picture of a desperate trio come
to avenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the man I&rsquo;m after,&rdquo; suddenly declared
Bill, pointing a finger at Thompson, of
Denver, who had been the center of an admiring
group. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s responsible for
old Bells. Let&rsquo;s see if you or any of your bunch
are as brave with a younger man. Come outside,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When first he began to speak, in that silky,
soft rumble, Thompson, who was nearly as
large as Mathews, assumed an air of amused disdain;
but before the speech was ended his face
went a little white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on away, you drunken loafers!&rdquo; he
said, half-turning, as if to resume his conversation.</p>
<p>Instantly Bill sprang at him; and it seemed
that he launched his sinewy bulk with a tiger&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
directness and deadliness straight through the
ten feet intervening. He drove his fist into the
face of the Denver man, and the latter swept
back against those behind him. Again he lifted
the merciless fist, and now began striking with
both with incredible rapidity. The battered
Thompson was driven back, to fall against a faro
layout. The miner bent him backward over the
table until he was resting on the wildly scattered
gold and silver coins, and struck again, and this
time the blood spurted in a stream, to run across
the green cloth, the staring card symbols, and the
case rack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill him, Bill, don&rsquo;t kill him!&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s
shout arose above the shouts of men and the
screams of dance-hall women. He had barely
time to observe, in a flash, that Bill had picked
the limp form of Thompson up, and heavy as it
was, lifted it high above his head and thrown
it violently into a vacant corner back of the table
in a crumpled heap, when he was almost felled
to the floor by a blow from behind, and turned to
fight his own battle with one of the Denver bullies.</p>
<p>His old gymnasium training stood him in good
stead; for, half-dazed by the blow, he could only
reel back and block the heavy fists that were
smashing toward him, when there came a sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
pause, and he saw that the smith had forced his
way forward and lunged, with his heavy, slow
arm, a deadly punch that landed under his assailant&rsquo;s
ear, and sent him limp and dazed to the
floor. The smith jumped forward and lifted
his heavy boot to kick the weaving face; but
Dick caught him by the arm, and whirled him
back in time to prevent needless brutality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another of &rsquo;em that hit Bells,&rdquo; the
smith yelled, pointing to a man who began desperately
edging toward the door.</p>
<p>All the rage of the primitive was aroused in
Dick by this time, the battle lust that dwells,
placidly through life, perhaps, in every man, but
which breaks loose in a torrent when once
unleashed. He leaped after the retreating man,
seized him by the collar, and gave a wrench that
tore coat, collar, and tie from the man&rsquo;s throat.
He drove a blow into the frightened face, and
yelled: &ldquo;That for old Bells Park! And that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room had become a pandemonium. Men
seemed striking everywhere. Fists were flying,
the bartenders and gamblers shouting for order;
and Dick looked back to where Smuts and Bill
were clearing a wide circle as they went after
individual members of Thompson&rsquo;s supporters
who were edging in. Suddenly he saw a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
leap on the bar, and recognized in him the man
who had been watchman at the Croix d&rsquo;Or.
Even in that tempestuous instant Dick wondered
at his temerity in entering the place.</p>
<p>Something glistened in the light, and he saw
that the watchman held a drawn revolver, and
was leveling it at Bill. The motion of the
fight was all that prevented the shot, as Mathews
leaped to and fro. A dozen men were between
Dick and the watchman; but almost under his
hand, at the edge of the bar, stood a whisky
bottle. He dove for it, brought it up, and
threw. The watchman, struck fairly on the
side of the head, dropped off backward, and fell
to the floor behind the bar, and his pistol
exploded harmlessly upward.</p>
<p>Instantly there came a change. From terrific
uproar the room became as still as a solitude.
Brutal and deadly as had been that fierce minute
or two of battle in which all men fought, or strove
to protect themselves from the maddened ones
nearest, the sound of the shot brought them to
their senses. A fight was one thing, a shooting
another. Gunmen as many of them were, they
dreaded the results if firearms were resorted to
in that dense mass of excited men, and each one
stood still, panting, listening, calmed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think Bells Park has played even,&rdquo; came
a calm, steady voice at the door.</p>
<p>They turned in surprise. Standing in the
doorway, motionless, scornful, and immaculate,
with her white hat still on her head, as if she had
just entered from the street, stood The Lily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Bells! Poor old man!&rdquo; she said,
in that panting silence, and then for what seemed
a long time looked at the floor. &ldquo;Bells Park,&rdquo;
she said at last, lifting her eyes, &ldquo;is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, and before any one could speak, she
clenched her hands at her sides, her eyes blazed,
her face twisted, and went white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said bitterly, in a voice low-pitched
and tortured with passion, &ldquo;I hate you! I hate
you! You brutes of Goldpan. You gambling
dogs! You purchasers of women. From this
time, forever, I am done with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her arms, opened her hands, and
made one wide, sweeping, inclusive gesture, and
turned and walked out into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! Dead! Bells is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick heard an unutterably sorrowful voice
exclaim; and Bill, half-denuded, his blue shirt in
shreds, his face puffed from blows, and his cut
knuckles dripping a slow, trickling red, plunged
toward him, followed by the smith. No one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
blocked their way as they went, the three together,
as they had come. Behind them, the room
broke into hushed, awed exclamations, and began
to writhe and twist, as men lifted and revived
the fallen, and took stock of their injuries.</p>
<p>Two men came running down the street with
weapons in hand; and the moonlight, which had
lifted until it shone white and clear into the
squalors of the camp, picked out dim blazes from
the stars on their breasts. They were the town
marshal and a deputy sheriff, summoned from
some distant saloon by the turmoil, and hastening
forward to arrest the rioters, not suspecting
that men were wanted for a graver offense.
Standing alone in the moonlight, in the middle of
the road, with her hands clenched before her, the
three men discerned another figure, and, when
they gained it, saw that in the eyes of The Lily
swam unshed tears.</p>
<p>Dick and the smith hastened onward toward
her rooms; but Bill abruptly turned, after they
had passed her, and spoke. They did not hear
what he said. They scarcely noted his pause,
for in but two or three steps he was with them
again, grimly hurrying to where lay the man they
had come to love.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XII_A_DISASTROUS_BLOW' id='CHAPTER_XII_A_DISASTROUS_BLOW'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A DISASTROUS BLOW</h3>
</div>
<p>In after years it all came back to Dick as a
horrible nightmare of unreality, that tragic
night&rsquo;s events and those which followed.
The grim setting of the coroner&rsquo;s jury, where
men with bestial, bruised, and discolored faces
sat awkwardly or anxiously, with their hats on
their knees, in a hard stillness; the grave questions
of the coroner, coupled with the harsh,
decisive interrogations of the prosecuting attorney,
who had been hastily summoned from the
county seat across the hills; and there in the
other room, quiet, and at rest, the faithful old
man who had given his life in defense of his
friends.</p>
<p>Dick gave his testimony in a dulled voice that
sounded strange and unfamiliar, telling all that
the engineer had said of the assault. He had one
rage of vindictiveness, when the three men from
Denver were identified as the ones who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
attacked the engineer, and regretted that they
were alive to meet the charge against them. He
but vaguely understood the technical phraseology
of Doctor Mills when he stated that Bells Park
died from the shock of the blows and kicks rained
on him in that last valorous chapter of his life.
He heard the decision placing the responsibility
on the men from Denver, saw the sheriff and his
deputies step forward and lay firm hands on
their arms and lead them away; and then was
aroused by the heavy entrance of the camp undertaker
to make ready, for the quiet sleep, the body
of Bells Park, the engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He belongs to us,&rdquo; said Dick numbly; &ldquo;to
Bill and me. He died for the Croix d&rsquo;Or. The
Croix d&rsquo;Or will keep him forever, as it would if
he had lived and we had made good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw, as they trudged past the High Light,
that its door was shut, and remembered, afterward,
a tiny white notice pasted on the glass.
The trail across the divide was of interminable
length, as was that other climb up to the foot of
the yellow cross on the peak, and to the grave he
had caused to be dug beside that other one which
Bells had guarded with jealous care, planted
with flowers, weeded, and where a faded, rough
little cross bore the rudely carved inscription:</p>
<p class='center'>A DISASTEROUS BLOW<br />
MEHITABLE PARK.<br />
THE BEST WOMAN THAT EVER LIVED.</p>
<p>Those who had come to pay the last honor to
the little engineer filed back down the hill, and the
Croix d&rsquo;Or was left alone, silent and idle. The
smoke of the banked fires still wove little heat
spirals above the stacks as if waiting for the man
of the engines. The men were shamefacedly
standing around the works and arguing, and one
or two had rolled their blankets and dumped
them on the bench beside the mess-house.</p>
<p>Two or three of them halted Dick and his
partner as they started up the little path to the
office building where they made their home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Bill asked, facing them with his
penetrating eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you boys to think we had
any hand in any of this,&rdquo; the old drill runner
said, taking the lead. &ldquo;They jobbed us. There
were but three or four of the Cross men there
when they voted a strike, and before that there
wasn&rsquo;t a man that hadn&rsquo;t taken the floor and
fought for your scale. The meeting dragged
for some reason, because old Bells kept bringing
up arguments&ndash;&ndash;long-winded ones&ndash;&ndash;as if holding
it off.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>He appeared to choke up a little, and gave a
swift glance over his shoulder at the yellow landmark
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of us had been there, they&rsquo;d never
have gotten him. We all liked Bells. But they
tell me that meeting was packed by that&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and
he suddenly flamed wrathful and used a foul
epithet&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;from Denver, and the three thugs he
brought with him. Mr. Townsend, there ain&rsquo;t
a man on the Cross that don&rsquo;t belong to the union.
You know what that means. You know how
hard it is for us to scab ourselves. But there
ain&rsquo;t a man on the Cross that hasn&rsquo;t decided to
stick by the mine if you want us. We&rsquo;re
making a protest to the head officers, and if that
don&rsquo;t go&ndash;&ndash;well, we stick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick impulsively put out his hand. He could
not speak. He was choking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want you, boys? Want you?&rdquo; Bill rumbled.
&ldquo;We want all of you. Every man jack on the
works. You know how she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; as well as we
do; but I&rsquo;m here to tell you that if the Cross
makes good, there&rsquo;ll be one set of men that&rsquo;ll
always have the inside edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men with the blankets grinned, and
furtively flung them through an open bunk-house
window. They all turned away, tongue-tied in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
emotion, as are nearly all men of the high hills,
and tried to appear unconcerned; while Dick,
still choking, led the way up the trail. The
unwritten law of the mines had decreed there
should be no work that day; and he saw the men
of the Cross pass down the road, arguing with
stolid emphasis against the injustice of the
ordered strike. He knew they would return to
the camp and continue that argument, with more
or less heat, and wondered what the outcome
would be.</p>
<p>He tried to forget his sorrow and bodily pains
by checking over his old assay slips, while Bill
wandered, like a bruised and melancholy survivor
of a battle, from the mill to the hoist, from
cabin to cabin, and mess-house to bunk-house,
stopping now and then to stare upward at the
peak, as if still thinking of that fresh and fragrant
earth piled in a mound above Bells Park.</p>
<p>Once, in the night, they were awakened by the
sounds of the men returning, as they discussed
their situation and interjected copious curses for
the instruments of the tragedy. Once again,
later, Dick was awakened by a series of blasts,
and turned restlessly in his bed, struck a match,
and looked at his watch, wondering if it had
all been a dream, and the morning shots of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
Rattler had aroused him. It was but three
o&rsquo;clock, and he returned to his troubled sleep
thinking that he must have been mistaken.
Barely half-awake, he heard Bill climb out of his
bed and don his clothing, the whistle pulled by
the new hands, and the clang of hammer on steel
in the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop. Then with a start, he
was aroused from the dreamless slumber of the
utterly exhausted by a heavy hand laid on his
shoulder and a heavy voice: &ldquo;Wake up, Dick!
Wake up, boy! They&rsquo;ve got us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat up, rubbing his eyes and fumbling with
the cordings of his pajamas. Bill was sitting
on the edge of his bed, scowling and angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got us? Got us?&rdquo; Dick repeated vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Dynamited the Peltons, and I&rsquo;m afraid
that ain&rsquo;t all. We&rsquo;ll have to go up the pipe line
to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick rolled out and jumped for his clothing.
He did not take time to follow his partner&rsquo;s
kindly suggestion that he had better go to the
mess-house and get the &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; to give him a
cup of hot coffee. He was too much upset by
the disaster, and walked rapidly over the trail.
Not a man was in sight around the works; and as
he passed the smith&rsquo;s door, he saw that Smuts,
too, had gone, without taking time to don his cap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
or doff his apron. The whole force appeared to
have collected around the power-house at the foot
of the hill, which was around a bend and shut off
from view of the Cross. A jagged rent, scattered
stone and mortar, and a tangle of twisted
steel told the story; but that was not the most
alarming damage he had to fear, for the heavy
steel pipe, where it entered the plant, was twisted
loose, gaping and dry.</p>
<p>He scrambled up the hill, seizing the manzanita
brush here and there to drag himself up
faster, and gained the brow where the pipe made
its last abrupt descent. Far ahead, and walking
sturdily, he recognized the stalwart figure of his
partner, and knew that Bill was suffering the
same anxiety. He ran when the ascent was less
steep, and shouted to the grizzled miner ahead,
who turned and waited for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of it,&rdquo; Bill called as he approached;
and Dick, breathless, made no reply,
but hurried ahead with him to the reservoir. In
all the journey, which seemed unduly long and
hot that morning, they said nothing. Once, as
they passed the familiar scene of his tryst with
Miss Presby, now ages past, Dick bit his lips,
and suppressed a moan like that of a hurt animal.
Bitterly he thought that now she was more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
unattainable, and his dreams more idle than
ever they had been. And the first sight of the
reservoir confirmed it.</p>
<p>To a large extent, the reservoir of the Cross
was artificial. It had been constructed by throwing
a deep stone and concrete dam across a narrow
ca&ntilde;on through which there percolated, in
summer, a small stream. Its cubic capacity was
such, however, that when this reservoir was
filled by spring freshets it contained water
enough to run the full season round if sparingly
used; and it was on this alone that the mill
depended for its power, and the mine for its
lights and train service, from hoist to breakers.</p>
<p>Where had stood the dam, gray with age and
moss-covered, holding in check its tiny lake, was
now nothing but ruins. The shots had been
placed in the lower point, which was fifty feet
down and conical as it struck and rested on the
mother rock. Whoever had placed the charges
knew well the explosive directions of his powder,
and his work had been disastrously effective.</p>
<p>The whole lower part of the dam was out,
and through it, in the night, had rushed the deluge
of water so vital to the Croix d&rsquo;Or. Small
trees that had grown up since the dam had been
built were uprooted in the bed of the ca&ntilde;on, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
great bowlders pulled from their sockets and
sent resistlessly downward. Where, the day before,
had been grassy beds and heavy growths of
ferns, was now but a naked bed, stripped to the
rock, down which flowed a small stream oozing
from what had been the reservoir.</p>
<p>The partners stood, as if paralyzed, on the
edge of the gulch, and looked down. The catastrophe,
coming on top of all that had gone before,
was a death blow, stupefying, stupendous,
and hopelessly irremediable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were right,&rdquo; Dick said despairingly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got us at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill nodded, without shifting his eyes from
the ruin below. They stood for another minute
before scrambling down the ca&ntilde;on&rsquo;s steep side
to inspect more closely the way the vandalism
had been effected. Slipping down the muddy
bank, heedless of their clothing or bruised hands,
they clambered over the broken pieces of wall,
and looked upward through the great hole and
into the daylight beyond. The blow was too
great to permit of mere anger. It was disaster
supreme, and they could find no words in that
time of despondency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give a hundred dollars toward a reward
for the man who did that,&rdquo; shouted a voice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
hoarse with indignation, above them; and they
looked up to see the smith on the bank, shaking
his smudged and clenched fist in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take a hundred more,&rdquo; growled one
of the drill runners in the augmenting group behind
him.</p>
<p>And then, as if the blow had fallen equally on
all, the men of the Cross stormed and raved, and
clambered over the ruins and anathematized
their unknown enemy; all but one known as Jack
Rogers, the boss millman, who silently, as if his
business had rendered him mute as well as deaf,
stood looking up and down the gulch. While
the others continued their inspection of the damage,
he drifted farther and farther away, intent
on the ground about him, and the edge of the
stream. Suddenly he stooped over and picked
up something water-stained and white. He came
back toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever did the one job,&rdquo; he said tersely,
&ldquo;did both. Probably one man. Set the fuses at
the power-house, then came on here and set these.
Then he must have got away by going to the
eastward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, how do you figure that
out?&rdquo; Dick asked eagerly, while the others gathered
closer around, with grim, inquiring faces,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
and leaned corded necks forward to catch the
millman&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a piece of fuse down at the power
plant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See, here it is. It&rsquo;s a good
long one. The fellow that did the job knew just
how long it would take him to walk here; and
he knew fuse, and he knew dynamite. The proof
that he did it that way is shown by this short
piece of fuse I found down there at the edge of
the wash. He cut the fuse short when he shot
the dam. He wanted the whole thing, both
places, to go up at once. Now it&rsquo;s plain as a Digger
Indian&rsquo;s trail that he didn&rsquo;t intend to go back
the way he came, so he must have gone eastward.
And if he went that way, it shows he didn&rsquo;t intend
to hit it back toward Goldpan, but to keep
on goin&rsquo; over the ridge cut-off till he hit the railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was astonished at the persistent reasoning
of the man whom hitherto he had regarded
as a singularly taciturn old worker, wise in milling
and nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if there&rsquo;s any of you boys here that
know trails,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come along with me, and
we&rsquo;ll section the hillside up there and pick it up.
If you don&rsquo;t, stay here, because I can get it in
time, and don&rsquo;t want no one tramplin&rsquo; over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
ground. I was&ndash;&ndash;a scout for five years, and&ndash;&ndash;well,
I worked in the Geronimo raid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Bill looked at him with a new admiration,
marveling that the man had never before
betrayed that much of his variegated and hard
career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right! I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; the
superintendent exclaimed. &ldquo;I can help you. So
can Dick. We&rsquo;ve lived where it came in handy
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But two other men joined them, one a white-headed
old miner called Chloride and the other
a stoker named Sinclair who had been at the
Cross for but a few weeks, and admitted that he
had been a packer in Arizona.</p>
<p>Slowly the men formed into a long line, and
began working toward one another, examining
the ground in a belt twenty feet wide and covering
the upper eastward edge of the ca&ntilde;on. Each
had his own method of trailing. The white-headed
man stooped over and passed slowly from
side to side. Bill walked with slow deliberation,
stopping every three or four feet and scanning
the ground around him with his brilliant, keen
eyes. The stoker worked like a pointer dog,
methodically, and examining each bush clump
for broken twigs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>But it was Rogers the millman, whose method
was more like Bill&rsquo;s, who gave the gathering
call. On a patch of earth, close by the side of
the rampart and where the moisture had percolated
sufficiently to soften the ground, was the
plain imprint of a man&rsquo;s foot, shod in miner&rsquo;s
brogans, and half-soled. Nor was that all. The
half-soling had evidently been home work, and
the supply of pegs had been exhausted. In lieu
of them, three square-headed hobnails had been
driven into the center of the seam holding the
patch of leather to the under part of the instep,
or palm of the foot. They were off like a pack
of bloodhounds, with the old millman in the lead.</p>
<p>Dick started to follow, and then paused. He
saw that Bill was standing aside, as if hesitating
what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, old partner,&rdquo; he said wearily, &ldquo;if anything
can be found they can find it. I think you
and I had better go back and try to think some
way out of this&ndash;&ndash;try to see some opening. It
looks pretty black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big fellow took four or five of his long,
swinging steps, and threw an arm over the
younger man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re a-givin&rsquo; us a right
fast run for our money; but we ain&rsquo;t whipped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
yet&ndash;&ndash;not by a long way! And if they do, well,
it&rsquo;s a mighty big world, with mighty big mountains,
and we&rsquo;ll strike it yet; but they haven&rsquo;t
cleaned us out of the Cross, and can&rsquo;t as long as
you and me are both kickin.&rsquo; They&rsquo;ve got poor
old Bells. They&rsquo;ve tried to hand us a strike.
They&rsquo;ve blown our reservoir so&rsquo;s we can&rsquo;t work
the mill until another spring passes over; and
yet we&rsquo;re still here, and the Croix d&rsquo;Or is still
there, off under the peak that&rsquo;s holdin&rsquo; it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved his arm above in a broad gesture,
and Dick took heart as they turned back toward
the mine, calculating whether they could find a
means of opening it underground to pay;
whether they would need as many men as they
had, and other troublesome details.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE DYNAMITER</h3>
</div>
<p>The men of the Croix d&rsquo;Or slowly made
their way upward toward the higher
crest of the range, spread out in an impatient
fan whose narrow point was made up of
the three experienced men. At times the trail
was almost lost in the carpet of pine needles and
heavy growths of mountain grass, and again it
would show plainly over long stretches where
the earth was exposed. It dipped down over a
crest and sought a hollow in which ran a mountain
stream, spread out over a rocky bed and
running swiftly. At its bank they paused. It
was plain that their man had taken to the water
to retard pursuit, if such came. The millman
threw up his hand and called the others around
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go any farther,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
find out how many shooting irons are in this
crowd. We may need &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>The men looked blankly at one another, expressing
by their actions the fact that in all
the party there was not one who possessed a
weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it seems to me the best thing to do is
for one man to go back to the mine and get
some,&rdquo; said Rogers, assuming leadership.
&ldquo;Who ever goes will find my gun hanging up at
the head of my bunk in a holster. Bring that
and the belt. There&rsquo;s cartridges in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One after another told where a weapon might
be found, and two men volunteered to return for
them. It was agreed that the others were to
keep on and that after leaving the stream men
were to be posted at intervals to guide the messengers
as they came up. Rogers proved something
of a general in the disposition of his little
army, and then, with Sinclair on one bank of the
stream and Chloride on the other, he plunged
into the water and began an up-stream course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands to reason,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;that our
man didn&rsquo;t go down stream unless it was for a
blind. He wouldn&rsquo;t double back because it would
bring him out almost where he started. He will
keep on up this way until she gets too small to
travel in and then will hit off somewhere else.
You other fellers keep behind.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>They began a slow, painstaking course up the
stream and began to fear they had been mistaken
in their surmise, when Sinclair gave a shout. He
had found the trail again, a telltale footprint
with the patched sole. It broke upward on the
other side of the ca&ntilde;on, and now men were posted
within shouting distance of one another and left
behind to notify the two men bringing weapons
which way to go. Across spots where the trail was
difficult or entirely lost, and still higher until the
timber line was passed and bare gray rocks were
everywhere, the man-hunters made their way,
and another watchman was left on the highest
point. Down the other side and into the timber
line again, directed only by a broken twig, a
freshly turned bowlder, or now and then a faint
suggestion of a footprint, they plunged as rapidly
as they could and then through tangled
brush until suddenly they came out to an old disused
path. Unerringly they picked up the footprints
again, and now these indicated that the
quarry had felt himself secure against pursuit and
made no further attempt at concealment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is heading out to the east, just as you
said he would,&rdquo; the smith declared, as he sat
down with the others to await the coming of the
messengers. They were certain now that henceforth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
they would travel rapidly. They talked in
low, angry voices among themselves, while Rogers,
silent and grim, sat quietly on a bowlder and
smoked. A shout from the hilltop attracted
their attention and they looked up to see a group
beginning to descend. The men with guns had
returned and the outposts doubled back on themselves
as they came, adding a man at intervals,
until they joined those waiting for them. Without
delay the men strung out in single file along
the path, with the old millman in the lead. For
the most part they went as quietly as would Indians
on the war-path, loping along now and then
down declivities, or panting upward when the trail
climbed to higher altitudes. There was no doubt
at all that the man who had dynamited the dam
was certain of his having evaded all followers,
and indeed he would have done so with men less
trained and astute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does any one know this country here?&rdquo; demanded
Rogers, suddenly halting his little band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; declared one of the drill runners. &ldquo;I
worked over here on this side one time about
two years ago. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where does this trail go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To an old logging camp, first, then from
there there is a road leading over to Malapi.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>Rogers lowered his hand from his ear and
looked thoughtful for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many men at the camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think it&rsquo;s been abandoned for two or
three years,&rdquo; replied the drill runner. Rogers
slapped his hand on his leg, and seemed confident
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll find him. In that
old, abandoned camp,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
ten-to-one bet that he got some supplies up there
some time within the last few days, when he
made up his mind to do this job, and that he
plans to lay quiet there until it is safe for him to
get out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others nodded their heads sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure of that,&rdquo; the drill runner said,
&ldquo;the best thing to do is for us to leave the trail
over here a ways and come up to the old camp
from behind it. He might be on the watch for
this trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good again!&rdquo; asserted the millman. &ldquo;Here,
you take the lead now and we&rsquo;ll follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For another hour they plugged along the trail
with an increasing alertness, and wondering
how soon the drill runner would turn off. At
last he looked back and gestured to them. They
understood. He slipped off the trail into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
brush and began going slowly. Once he stopped
to whisper to them to be cautious, inasmuch as
within a few hundred yards they would reach
their goal. Now they began to exercise the
utmost caution of movement, spreading out according
to individual judgment to avoid windfalls
and thickets. Again the lead man stopped
and signaled them. He beckoned with his arm,
and they closed up and peered where he indicated.</p>
<p>Out in the center of a clearing stood a big,
rambling structure that had done service and
been abandoned. A slow wisp of smoke, gray
and thin, floated upward from the rough chimney,
a part of whose top rocks had been dislodged
by winter storms. They dropped to the ground
and held a whispered consultation. They argued
heatedly over the best course to pursue. The
millman favored surrounding the cabin, and
then permitting him with two others to advance
boldly to the door and endeavor to capture their
man.</p>
<p>The packer, Sinclair, suggested another course,
which was nothing less valorous than a straight
rush for the doors and windows; but Chloride
fought that plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m afraid to take my chances,&rdquo;
he declared; &ldquo;but if we do that, some of us, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
such a crowd, is sure to get shot. We don&rsquo;t want
to lose no lives on a skunk of a dynamiter like
this feller must be. I&rsquo;m for surroundin&rsquo; the
house, then callin&rsquo; him out. If he&rsquo;s an honest
man, he&rsquo;ll come. If he ain&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;ll fight. Then
we&rsquo;ll get him in the long run if we have to fire
the cabin to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe burn a couple of million dollars
worth of timber with it at the same time,&rdquo;
growled the drill runner. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine idea!
I&rsquo;m for Jack&rsquo;s plan. First, line out around the
cabin, out of sight of course, then two men walk
up and get him. I&rsquo;m one of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I the other,&rdquo; declared Rogers. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
lose no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently, as before, the party spread out until
it had completed the ring around the cabin and
then, when all was in readiness, the millman and
the runner, with pistols loosened, stepped out into
the open and walked around to the door. There
was a moment&rsquo;s tensity as they made that march,
neither they nor the watchers knowing when a
shot might sound and bring one of them to the
ground. The runner rapped on the door, insistently.
It creaked and gave back a sodden, hollow
sound, but at first there was no response. He
rapped again, and at the same time tried to open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
it; but it was barred. A voice from inside called,
&ldquo;Hello! What do you want out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see you,&rdquo; the runner answered.
&ldquo;Open the door, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an instant&rsquo;s hesitation and then
again the voice, &ldquo;Well, what do you want?
Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men that ain&rsquo;t familiar with these
parts,&rdquo; was the wary reply of the runner. &ldquo;Want
to talk it over with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the creaking of a bar, and the door
was opened cautiously. One eye applied to a
crack scanned the runner, who stood there alert.
Rogers was out of sight. Apparently the man in
the cabin did not recognize the runner, for now
he flung the door wide and stepped out. As he
did so he saw the millman, whom he recognized,
and swiftly pulled a gun and shot at him. Even
as he did so the younger man leaped upon him,
caught his wrist and wrenched the weapon from
his hand. He did the unexpected thing. Instead
of fighting, or attempting to regain the cabin,
he deftly threw out a foot, tripped the runner
against Rogers, leaped over both as they fell, and
dashed headlong for the forest. Suddenly, as
he gained the edge, several shots cracked
viciously, but none of them seemed to have taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
effect. He snarled loudly with excitement and
plunged into the edge of the timber. Quite as
quickly as he gained it a man arose straight in
his path, leaped forward, caught him around
the waist, and brought him to the ground. Men
came rushing forward, almost falling over one
another, but arrived too late to assist in the capture.
Lying under and pinned to the earth by
the huge blacksmith, struggling for release, and
cursing between shut teeth, was the man who had
been the watchman at the Croix d&rsquo;Or when its
new proprietor arrived, the man Wolff, whose
past had been exposed by The Lily in the presence
of some of those who were now his captors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have guessed it,&rdquo; growled the smith.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like him, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two others reached over and assisted him.
They caught Wolff by his arms and lifted him to
his feet, where they held him. Another man ran
his hand over his clothes and took out a big hunting
knife, sheathed. A further search revealed
nothing save a small sum of money and a few
dynamite caps. The prisoner attempted to
brazen it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by this, anyhow?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;Bein&rsquo; held up, am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one replied to him directly, but it was Rogers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
who said, &ldquo;Lift his feet up there until we
get a look at the shoes.&rdquo; Unceremoniously they
hoisted him clear of the ground, although in a
sudden panic he kicked and struggled. There
was no doubt of it. The shoes were identical
with those worn by the man who had dynamited
the reservoir dam. The hobnails had betrayed
him. For the first time he seemed to lose courage
and whined a protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you last night?&rdquo; demanded the
smith, frowning in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here in this cabin. Been here two days
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked him between them back to the
door and Chloride and Sinclair went in. They
inspected it closely. They dropped to their knees
and examined the deposit of dust. They walked
over to the fireplace and inspected the ash surrounding
the little blaze, which had been started
less than an hour before, as far as they could
decide. Below was a heap of mouldy ash that
had been beaten down by winter snows and summer
rains falling through the broken chimney.
The others watched the two inquisitors curiously
through the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has been here two days he has moved
around the room scarcely at all,&rdquo; Sinclair declared,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
&ldquo;because the dust isn&rsquo;t disturbed by more
than one or two trails. And, what&rsquo;s more, that
fire is the first one that has been built here in
many a long month, and it wasn&rsquo;t started very
long ago. It&rsquo;s too thin. He just got here! He&rsquo;s
the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner was ringed round by accusing,
scowling eyes. He shoved a dry tongue out and
wet his lips as if the nervous strain were beginning
to tell. He started to speak, but apparently
decided to say nothing and stood looking at the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; demanded Rogers, &ldquo;what have you
to say for yourself? You&rsquo;ve plainly lied about
being here in the cabin. What did you do that
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that I was in the cabin. I slept
outside,&rdquo; Wolff growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take us to the place where you
camped,&rdquo; suggested one of the drill runners. A
chorus of approving shouts seconded his request;
but Wolff began to appear more confused than
ever and did not answer. He took refuge in a
fierce burst of anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you fellows mean, anyhow?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo;. What right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
have you to come up here and grab a man that
way? Who are you lookin&rsquo; for, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolff,&rdquo; said the old millman, steadily, &ldquo;we
are looking for the man that blew up the Croix
d&rsquo;Or power-house and dam last night. And
what&rsquo;s more, we think we&rsquo;ve got him. You&rsquo;re
the man, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His attempts to pretend ignorance and innocence
were pitiful. This impromptu court was
trying him there in the open beside the cabin, and
he knew that its verdict would be a speedy one.
He started to run the gamut of appeal, denial,
and anger; but his hearers were inflexible. They
silenced him at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need just one thing more, boys,&rdquo; said
Rogers, &ldquo;and that is to be sure that these are
the same boots that made the tracks there by the
dam. All we have to do to prove that is to take
this fellow back with us. The tracks will still be
there. If they are the same we can be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added the blacksmith.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be proof enough. Let&rsquo;s move out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They knotted their huge handkerchiefs and
bound his arms at the elbows and then his hands
at the wrists, and started him forward. He
fought at first, but on being prodded sharply with
the muzzle of a gun moved sullenly in their midst
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
along the trail he had so lately come over. They
trudged in a harsh silence, save now and then
when he tried to persuade them of his innocence,
only to convince them further that he lied. Their
return was made much faster than their coming,
for now they had no need to seek a trail, nor to
walk in a mountain stream. They forged ahead
rapidly under the direction of the runner who had
been in that part of the mountains before, and
yet it was almost dusk when they came down the
hill above the great wreck. They led him to the
big heap of broken masonry and then ordered
him to sit down. He had to be thrown from his
feet, after which they removed his shoes, and
while two of them stood guard over him the
others descended to the edge of the wall and
found the clear-cut prints which had been first
noted that morning and which, trailed, had led
to his capture. They struck matches to be certain
that there was no mistake and bent over
while Rogers carefully pressed one of the shoes
into the mud beside that first imprint. They
were undoubtedly the same. He then fitted the
shoe into that track, and all further proof was
unnecessary. Grimly they passed back to where
Wolff was being guarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Rogers, gravely, &ldquo;this is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the man! There isn&rsquo;t a doubt of it. Now you
all know who he is, what his past has been, what
he has done here, and I want to get your ideas
what should be done with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smith stepped forward and took off his
hat. It was as if he knew that he were the one
to impose a death sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t but one thing for the likes of
him. That&rsquo;s hangin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he declared, steadily. &ldquo;I
vote to hang him. Here and now, across the end
of the dam he shot out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped back into the closely drawn circle.
Rogers faced man after man, calling the name
of each. There was no dissenting voice. The
verdict was unanimous. So certain had been the
outcome that one of their number had started
along the pipe line to the wreck of the power-house
for a rope before ever they compared the
imprints of the telltale shoes, and now, almost by
the time they had cast their ballot, this man
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolff, you&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; said the old millman,
with solemnity. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got any messages
you want sent, we&rsquo;ll send them. If you want
time to pray, this is your chance. There&rsquo;s nothing
you can say is going to change it. You are
as good as dead. Boys, some of you get one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
of those beams that&rsquo;s tore loose there at the side,
fasten the rope around the end, and shove it over
the edge of the wall above the ca&ntilde;on there for
a few feet. He shall hang above the dam he
dynamited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolff knew that they were in earnest. There
was something more inexorable in their actions
than in a court of law. At the last he showed
some courage of a brute kind, reviling them all,
sputtering forth his hatred, and interlarding it
with a confession and threats of what he wanted
to do. They silenced him by leading him to the
wall and adjusting the noose. Once more Rogers
besought him to pray and then, when he again
burst into oaths, they thrust him off. The fall
was as effective as ever hangman devised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning, boys,&rdquo; said the smith, &ldquo;a
half-dozen of us must be up early and come back
here. The hound is at least entitled to a half-way
decent burial. I&rsquo;ll call some of you to come
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was their sole comment. They had
neither regrets, compunctions, nor rancor. They
had finished their task according to their own
ideas of justice, without hesitation.</p>
<p>At the Croix d&rsquo;Or the partners, worried over
their problems, and somewhat astonished at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
non-appearance of the force, sat on the bench by
the mess-house, smoking and silent.</p>
<p>In soft cadence they heard, as from the opposite
side of the gulch, the tramping of feet. Swinging
along in the dusk the men came, shadowy,
unhalting, and homeward bound, like so many
tired hounds returning after the day&rsquo;s hunt.
Their march led them past the bench; but they
did not look up. There was an unusual gravity
in their silence, a pronounced earnestness in their
attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; called Dick, &ldquo;what did you learn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the smith who answered, but the others
never halted, continuing that slow march to the
bunk-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanging to a beam across the dam he blew
up,&rdquo; was the remorseless response.</p>
<p>He started as if to proceed after the others,
then paused long enough to add: &ldquo;It was that
feller that used to be watchman here; the feller
that tried to shoot Bill that night. Found him in
that old, deserted cabin near the Potlach. Had
the shoe on him, and at last said he did it, and
was sorry for just one thing, that he didn&rsquo;t get
all of us. Said he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; blown the bunk-house and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
the office up in a week more, and that he&rsquo;d tried
to get you two with a bowlder and had killed your
burros&ndash;&ndash;well, when we swung him off, he was
still cursing every one and everything connected
with the Croix d&rsquo;Or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for an instant, then came closer, and
lowered his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that ain&rsquo;t all. He said just before he
went off&ndash;&ndash;just like this&ndash;&ndash;mind you: &lsquo;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; got
Bully Presby, too, because he didn&rsquo;t treat me fair,
after me doin&rsquo; my best and a-keepin&rsquo; my mouth
shut about what I knew of the big lead.&rsquo; Now,
what in hell do you suppose he meant by that?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;THOUGH LOVE SAY NAY&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of one thing I am sure,&rdquo; said Dick on
the following day, when they began
to readjust themselves for a decision,
&ldquo;and that is that if we can find work for them,
there isn&rsquo;t a man on the works that I don&rsquo;t want
to keep. They are too true and loyal to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could drive into the blacksmith&rsquo;s tunnel,&rdquo;
Bill said; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve an idea we might strike
something when we pass under that hard cone
just above&ndash;&ndash;well, just about under where Bells
is. I saw it yesterday when we were up there
for the first time. That would give the millman
and his gang something to do. Some of &rsquo;em can
take out the rest of the green lead, and after
that drift see if it comes in again. And the
others that can&rsquo;t do anything underground, can
turn to and build up the dam, with a few masons
to help, and, when a new wheel comes, the millman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
will know how to set that all right again.
So, you see, we don&rsquo;t have to lose any of them
that has stood by us, so long as Sloan is ready
to take his gamble and the hundred thousand
lasts. Before that&rsquo;s gone, we&rsquo;ll just have to make
good. And somehow I feel we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if to add to the mental trials of the half-owner
of the Croix d&rsquo;Or, but another day
elapsed after this decision and adjustment before
he received a letter from a Seattle broker offering
him a price for his interest in the mine. Thus
wrote the agent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My client has the timber and water rights of
your property in view more than anything underground,
which, on the advice of experts who have
visited the property in previous years, he seems
to regard as worthless. He informs me that you
are, to all intents, representing not only your
own interest, but that of the other partner, who
places implicit confidence in you. I presume that
you will therefore be amenable to doing all you
can to save from the wreckage of the dead property
all that is possible in behalf of that partner
as well as yourself, and am authorized to make
you the extremely liberal offer of sixty thousand
dollars for the full title to the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The price was ridiculously low, and Dick knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
it; yet if the mine produced nothing more, and
was, as the experts were supposed to have reported,
worthless, the amount was extremely liberal.
But for Bill he would have hesitated to
decline such an offer. That worthy, however,
threw his head back and roared derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty thousand? Sixty thousand! What
does that idiot think men who have dropped a
quarter of a million in a property would quit for?
Does he think that sixty thousand is any saving
from a wreck like this has been? Tell him to
chase himself&ndash;&ndash;that the tail goes with the hide,
and you&rsquo;ll quit clean whipped, or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dick was loath to refuse any offer without
consulting his superior in New York, and accordingly
wandered off into the hills to think. It was
late in the afternoon, and he mechanically
tramped over the trail to the pipe line, where,
when hope ran higher, he had dared to dream.</p>
<p>The whole situation had become a nerve-racking
tragedy of mind and action. His desperate
desire for success after his self-acknowledgment
that he loved Miss Presby, and then the blows
that had been rained on him and the mine, the
failure of the green lead to hold out when it had
at least promised and justified operation&ndash;&ndash;all
cumulated into a disheartening climax which was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
testing his fortitude as it had never been tried
before. He was not of those who lack either persistence,
determination, or moral bravery; and
it was this last characteristic, coupled with a certain
maturing caution, which made him question
the honesty of proceeding to lay out, perhaps, the
entire hundred thousand volunteered by Sloan,
with such little certainty of returns. Had the
money been his own, he would have taken the
chances uncomplainingly; but his judgment told
him that, had he been sent to the Croix d&rsquo;Or as
an expert to pass an opinion on the justification
of putting a hundred thousand into the ground,
under present conditions, he would have advised
against it.</p>
<p>He went as far as the reservoir. Its wreckage
seemed to mock his efforts. To rebuild it alone
meant big expense in a country where every barrel
of cement had to be brought in on the backs
of pack mules, and where stone masons received
unduly high wages. The repairs to the plant
would not prove so heavy; but after that? None
knew better than he the trials of expensive prospecting
underground, the long drives to end in
nothing, the drifts that tapped no ore, the ledges
that promised to come in strongly, and led the
worker on with hope deferred until his purse was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
exhausted. The cruelty of nature itself flaunting
the golden will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp in the blackness of the
earth.</p>
<p>He stood on a timber thrown carelessly on the
brink of the gorge, and suddenly thought how
it happened to be there, and for what tragic purpose
it had served&ndash;&ndash;a gallows. He shuddered,
thinking of the mentally distorted wretch who
had died at its end, cursing as the men of the
Cross pushed him over to gasp and wrench his
life away fifty feet above the ruin he had wrought.
He wondered where the man had been buried,
and hurried back along the pipe line to try and
forget that episode.</p>
<p>A little flutter of white from a clump of brush
attracted his eyes, and he extracted from the
brambles a dainty handkerchief still fragrant with
the personality of the girl he loved. He lifted
it to his lips tightly, and, with a heart that was
almost in pain, dropped to the line, and sat on the
pipe, bent, and utterly dejected. He sat there for
some minutes, and then a sound caused him to
straighten himself with a jerk. The black horse
was thundering down the hill as he had seen it
on those other mornings when, looking backward,
the &ldquo;world was young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you, Mr. Townsend,&rdquo; Miss Presby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
said as he assisted her to alight, and her voice
was sympathetic and grave. &ldquo;You are unhappy.
I don&rsquo;t blame you. I have heard all about it, and&ndash;&ndash;well,
I have had to fight an hourly impulse to
come to you ever since I heard the news. Oh, my
friend, believe me, I am so sorry! So sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not reply, lest his voice betray the
emotions aroused by her kindly sympathy. All
his yearnings were fanned to flame by the cadence
of her voice and the softness of her eyes.
Mechanically he resumed his place on the pipe,
and she seated herself by his side, half-facing
him. Her slender foot, booted, braced against
the ground, and almost touching his heavy miner&rsquo;s
boot, tapped its toe on the sward as if she were
impatient to find words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a little tough,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it
seems less hard to me now that I know you
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had blundered in his first words to the
beginning of dangerous heights, and his pulses
gave a wild throb when he glanced up at her and
saw a light in her face, in her eyes, in her whole
attitude, that he had never surprised there before.
Words, unuttered, leaped hotly from his heart;
a mad desire to tell of his love, of the visions
he had seen in the air, on the blue of the peaks,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
in the cool shadows of the forests, in the black
depths hundreds of feet under the ground. Of
how the Croix d&rsquo;Or had come to represent, not
financial success, but a battle for her, and his
love.</p>
<p>His face went white, and he bit his dry, twisting
lips, and clenched his hands until they hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now!&rdquo; he savagely commanded himself.
&ldquo;Not now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She appeared to be thinking of something she
had to say, and her first words rendered him
thankful that he had held his tongue, otherwise
he might never have known the depths of the girl
seated there by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think me forward,&rdquo; she
said quietly; &ldquo;but I have wanted for the last two
days to ask you something. It makes it easier
now that I know you know, that&ndash;&ndash;that I care
for it. What are your&ndash;&ndash;your&ndash;&ndash;how are your
finances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had stammered it out at last, and, now that
the conversation had been led in that direction,
he could speak. He sat there quietly, as if by a
comrade, and told her all. Told her of his boyhood,
his father&rsquo;s death, and that he, in his own
right, had nothing in the world but youth and a
half-ownership in the Croix d&rsquo;Or, which threatened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
to prove worthless. He voiced that dread
of wasting his backer&rsquo;s money when he had none
of his own to put with it, meeting dollar for dollar
as it was thrown into the crucibles of fate.
He stopped at last, a little ashamed of having so
completely unbosomed himself, for he was by
habit and nature reticent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made it a great deal easier for
me,&rdquo; she said, with an assumption of gayety. &ldquo;I
can say what I&rsquo;ve been thinking of for two days
without spludging all over my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed as if in recollection of her previous
embarrassment, and again became seriously
grave, and went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say my father is a hard man. At times
I have been led to believe it; but he has been a
good father to me, and I appreciate it and his
worries more, after a four years&rsquo; absence in an
Eastern school, and&ndash;&ndash;well, perhaps because I am
so much older now, and better able to judge
leniently. I have never known much of his business
from his lips. It is one subject on which
he is not exactly loquacious, as probably you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she laughed a little, grim laugh. Dick
had opened his lips to say that he had never met
her father, when she continued:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;On the day I met you first, up here by your
pipe line, the day you almost ended my bright
young career by starting a half-ton bowlder down
the hill&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t interrupt with repeated apologies,
please&ndash;&ndash;I had my birth anniversary. I was
twenty-one, and&ndash;&ndash;my own boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, belated, but fervent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; but you again interrupt. On
that day when I went home, my father, in his customary
gruff way, turned back just as he was
going to the office where he lives at least eighteen
hours out of every twenty-four, and threw in my
lap a bank-book. &lsquo;Joan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re of age
now. That&rsquo;s for you. It&rsquo;s all yours, to do just
what you dam&rsquo; please with. I have nothing to
do with it. If you make a fool use of it, it&rsquo;ll be
your fault, not mine. I&rsquo;m giving it to you so
that if anything happened to me, or the Rattler,
you&rsquo;d not be helplessly busted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jumped to his feet with an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rattler! The Rattler! And&ndash;&ndash;and your
name is Joan and not Dorothy, and you are Bully
Presby&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was bewildered by surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Certainly! Didn&rsquo;t you know that&ndash;&ndash;all
this time?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he blurted. &ldquo;There is a Dorothy
Presby, and a&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy Presby!&rdquo; She doubled over in a
gust of mirth. &ldquo;The daughter of the lumberman
over on the other side. Oh, this is too good
to keep! I must tell her the next time I see her.
After all these months, you still thought&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again her laughter overwhelmed her; but it
was not shared by Dick, who stood above her on
the slope, frowning in perplexity, thinking of the
strange blunder into which he had been led by
the words of poor old Bells, his acceptance of her
identity, his ignorance that Bully Presby had kith
or kin, and of the mine owner&rsquo;s sarcastic references
and veiled antagonism throughout all those
troubled months preceding.</p>
<p>If she were Bully Presby&rsquo;s daughter, he might
never gain her father&rsquo;s consent, though the Croix
d&rsquo;Or were in the list of producers. He thought
of that harsh encounter on the trail, and his assertion
that he was capable of attending to his own
business and asked neither friendship nor favor
from any man under the skies; of Bully Presby&rsquo;s
gruff reply, and of their passing each other a second
time, in the streets of Goldpan, without
recognition. The girl in front of him, so unlike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
her father save for the firm chin and capable
brow, did not appear to sense his perturbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I am
not jeal&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; I&rsquo;m not any different&ndash;&ndash;just the
same. Come back here and sit down, please,
while I go ahead with what I wish to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interlude appeared to have rendered her
more self-possessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, on that day I met you, I became quite
rich. That money has rested in a bank, doing
neither me nor any one else any benefit. I think
I have drawn one check, for twenty-five dollars,
just to convince myself that it was all reality.
And I am, in some ways, the daughter of my
father. I want my money to work. I&rsquo;m quite a
greedy young person, you see. I want to lend you
as much of that money as you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I have as much faith in you, perhaps
more, than this Mister Sloan, of whom I&rsquo;m
a trifle jealous. I want to have a share in your
success. I want to make you feel that, even if I&rsquo;m
not the daughter of a lumberman, I am, and shall
have a right to be, interested in&ndash;&ndash;in&ndash;&ndash;the Croix
d&rsquo;Or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any such thing. I mean it!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s because I haven&rsquo;t made it plain to
you&ndash;&ndash;haven&rsquo;t made you understand that even now
I am thinking, to preserve my honor, of telling
Mr. Sloan that it is too much of a venture. If
I should decline to venture his money, why should
I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refuse mine? That&rsquo;s just it. His money
you could decline. He isn&rsquo;t on the ground. He
doesn&rsquo;t know mines, mining, or miners. I know
them all. I am here. I know the history of the
Cross from the day it made its first mill run. I
went five hundred feet under ground in a California
mine when I was a month old. I&rsquo;ve run
from the lowest level to the top of the hoist, and
from the grizzlies to the tables, for at least ten
years of my life. I&rsquo;ve absorbed it. I&rsquo;ve lived
in it. Had I the strength, there isn&rsquo;t a place in
this, or any mine, that I couldn&rsquo;t fill. I&rsquo;m backing
my judgment. The Croix d&rsquo;Or will prove
good with depth. It may never pay until you
get it. The blowing of your dam, the loss of
your green lead, and all of those troubles, don&rsquo;t
amount to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snapped a thumb and forefinger derisively,
and went on before he could interject a word, so
intent was she on assisting him and encouraging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
him, and proving to him that her judgment,
through knowledge, was better than his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Borrow my money, Dick, and sink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name came so easily to her lips! It was
the first time he had ever heard her utter it. It
swept away his flying restraint even as the flame
of powder snaps through a fuse to explosion;
and he made a sudden, swinging step toward her,
and caught her in his arms savagely, greedily,
tenderly fierce. All his love was bursting, molten,
to speech; but she lifted both hands and thrust
herself away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not that!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not that! I
wish you had not. It robs me of my wish. I
wanted you to take my money as a comrade, not
as my&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Oh, Dick! Dick! Don&rsquo;t say anything
to me now, or do anything now! Please let
me have my way. You will win. I know it!
The Cross must pay. It shall pay! And when
it does, then&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood, trembling, and abashed by her own
words, before him. Slowly the delicacy of her
mind, the romanticism of her dreams, the great,
unselfish love within her, fluttering yet valiant,
overwhelmed him with a sense of infinite unworthiness
and weakness. He took his hat from
his head, leaned over, and caught one of the palpitant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
hands in both his own, and raised it reverently
to his lips. It was as if he were paying
homage to heaven devoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said softly, still clinging
to the fingers, every throb of which struck appealingly
on his heartstrings. &ldquo;Forgive me, and&ndash;&ndash;yet&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t.
Joan, little Joan, I can&rsquo;t take your
money. It would make me a weakling. But I
can make the Cross win. If it never had a chance
before, it will have now. It must! God wouldn&rsquo;t
let it be otherwise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me to my horse,&rdquo; she said faintly.
&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t talk any more. Let us keep our
hopes as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted her lightly to the saddle, and the
big black, with comprehending eyes, seemed to
stand as a statue after she was in her seat. The
purple shadows of the mountain twilight were,
with a soft and tender haze, tinting the splendid
peak above them. Everything was still and
hushed, as if attuned to their parting. She leaned
low over her saddle to where, as before something
sacred, he stood with parted lips, and upturned
face, bareheaded, in adoration. Quite slowly she
bent down and kissed him full on the lips, and
whispered: &ldquo;God bless you, dear, and keep you&ndash;&ndash;for
me!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>The abrupt crashing of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs awoke
the echoes and the world again. She was gone;
and, for a full minute after the gray old rocks
and the shadows had encompassed her, there
stood in the purple twilight a man too overcome
with happiness to move, to think, to comprehend,
to breathe!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;MR. SLOAN SPEAKS&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Somethin&rsquo; seems to have kind
of livened up the gloom of this
dump, seems to me,&rdquo; exclaimed Bill
on the following morning, when returning from
his regular trip underground, he stamped into the
office, threw himself into a chair, and hauled off
one of his rubber boots preparatory to donning
those of leather.</p>
<p>Dick had been bent over the high desk, with
plans unrolled before him, and a sheet of paper on
which he made calculations, whistling as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time I&rsquo;ve heard you whistle since we
left the C&oelig;ur d&rsquo;Alenes,&rdquo; Bill went on, grinning
slyly, as if secretly pleased. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you
up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding out if by sinking we couldn&rsquo;t cut that
green lead about two hundred feet farther down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully boy! I&rsquo;m with you!&rdquo; encouraged the
older miner, throwing the cumbersome boots into
the corner, and coming over behind Dick, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
he could inspect the plans across the angle of the
other&rsquo;s broad shoulder. &ldquo;How does she dope
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cut the green lead on the six-hundred-foot,
at a hundred and ten feet from the shaft,
didn&rsquo;t we? Well, the men before us cut on the
five-hundred at a hundred and seventy from the
shaft, and at two-twenty from the shaft on the
four-hundred-foot level, where they stoped out
a lot of it before concluding it wouldn&rsquo;t pay to
work. It was a strong but almost barren ledge
when they first came into it on the two-hundred-foot
level. The Bonanza chute made gold because
they happened to hit it at a crossing on the
four-hundred-foot level. At the six-hundred, as
we know, it was almost like a chimney of ore
that is playing out as we drift west. If the mill
had not been put out of business, we were going
to stope it out, though, and prove whether it was
the permanent ledge, weren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, pardner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, at the same angle, we would have
to drift less than seventy feet on the seven-hundred-foot
level to cut it again, and at the eight-hundred-foot
we&rsquo;d just about have it at the foot
of the shaft. Well, I&rsquo;m sinking, regardless of
expense.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It might be right, boy, it might be right,&rdquo;
Bill said, thoughtfully scowling at the plans, and
going over the figures of the dip. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re
the boss. What you say goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; hesitatingly, &ldquo;or, anyway, it&rsquo;s worth
takin&rsquo; a chance on. Bells used to say the mines
around here all had to get depth, and that most
of the ledges came in stronger as they went down.
The Cross ain&rsquo;t shown it so far, but eight hundred
feet ought to show whether that&rsquo;s the right
line of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the sump hole under the shaft?&rdquo;
Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be somewhere about seventy or eighty
feet of water in it; but we can pump that out in
no time. She isn&rsquo;t makin&rsquo; much water. Almost
a dry mine now, for some reason I don&rsquo;t quite
get. Looks as if it leaked away a good deal,
somewhere, through the formation. There
wouldn&rsquo;t be no trouble in sinkin&rsquo; the shaft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thirty feet, about, would bring us to
the seven-hundred-foot mark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you what I want to do: I want
you to shift the crew so that there is a day and
a night shift. The rebuilding of the dam can be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
put off for a while, except for such work as the
millmen are agreeable to take on. I want to sink!
I don&rsquo;t want to waste any time about it. I want
to go down just as fast as it can be done, and
when we get to the seven-hundred-foot, one gang
must start to drift for the green lead, and the
others must keep going down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was almost knocked over the desk by a
rousing, enthusiastic slap on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re my old pardner again!&rdquo; Bill
shouted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the lad again that was fresh
from the schools, knew what he wanted, and went
after it. Dick, I&rsquo;ve been kind of worried about
you since we came here,&rdquo; the veteran went on, in
a softer tone of voice. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t been like the
old Dick. You ain&rsquo;t had the zip! It&rsquo;s as if you
were afraid all the time of losing Sloan&rsquo;s money,
and it worried you. And sometimes&ndash;&ndash;now, I
don&rsquo;t want you to get sore and cuss me&ndash;&ndash;it seemed
to me as if your mind wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t altogether on the
job! As if the Cross didn&rsquo;t mean everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited expectantly for a moment, as if
inviting a confidence; then, observing that the
younger man was flushed, and not looking at him,
grinned knowingly, and trudged out of the office,
calling back as he went: &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be sump water
in the creek in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>As if imbued with new energy, he ordered one
of the idle millmen to act as stoker, if he cared
to do so, which was cheerfully done, had the extra
pump attached, saw the fire roaring from another
boiler, and by noon the shaft rang with the steady
throb of the pistons pounding and pulling the
waste water upward. The last of the unwatering
of the Cross was going forward in haste. By six
o&rsquo;clock in the evening he reported that soundings
showed that the map had not been checked up,
and that the shaft was seven hundred and ten
feet deep, and that they would commence a drift
on the seven-hundred-foot mark the next day.</p>
<p>Dick was awakened at an early hour, and found
Bill missing. He went over to the hoist house,
where a sleepy night man, new to the hours,
grinned at him with a pleasant: &ldquo;Looks like
we&rsquo;re busy, just&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;same, Mr. Townsend!
The old man&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the superintendent of a mine is
always &ldquo;the old man,&rdquo; be he but twenty&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;left
orders last night that when the water was clear
at seven hundred feet he was to be called. He
kicked up two of the drill men at four this mornin&rsquo;,
and they&rsquo;re down there puttin&rsquo; the steel into
the rock ever since. Hear &rsquo;em? He&rsquo;s makin&rsquo;
things hump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick leaned over the unused compartment of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
the shaft, and heard the steady, savage chugging
of the drills. Bill was &ldquo;makin&rsquo; things hump!&rdquo;
with a vengeance.</p>
<p>A man who had been sent to the camp for the
semi-weekly mail arrived while the partners were
at breakfast, and the first letter laid before them
was one with a New York postmark, which Dick
read anxiously. It was from Sloan, who told
him that he had been unexpectedly called to the
Pacific coast on a hurried trip, and that, while
he did not have time to visit the Croix d&rsquo;Or, he
very earnestly hoped that Dick would arrange, on
receipt of the letter, to meet him in Seattle, and
named a date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whe-e-w! You got to move some, ain&rsquo;t you?
Let&rsquo;s see, if you want to meet him you&rsquo;ll have to
be hittin&rsquo; the trail out of here in an hour,&rdquo; said
Bill, laying down his knife and fork. &ldquo;What do
you s&rsquo;pose is up? Goin&rsquo; to tie the poke strings
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick feared something was amiss. And he continued
to think of this after he had written a hasty
note to Joan, telling her of his abrupt absence,
and that he expected to return in a week. He pondered
for a moment whether or not to add some
note of affection, but decided that he was still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
under her ban, and so contented himself with the
closing line:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am following your advice. We are
sinking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had to run, bag in hand, to catch the stage
from Goldpan, and as it jolted along over the
rough passes and rugged inclines had a medley
of thought. Sometimes he could not imagine why
Sloan had been so anxious to talk with him, and
in the other and happier intervals, he thought
of Joan Presby, daughter of the man whom he
had come to regard as antagonistic in many ways.</p>
<p>The confusion of mind dwelt with him persistently
after he had boarded the rough &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo;
that carried him to the main line, where
he must wait for the thunderous arrival of the
long express train that was to carry him across
the broad and splendid State of Washington.
Idaho and Oregon were left behind. The magnificent
wheat belt spread from horizon to horizon,
and harvesters paused to wave their hats at
the travelers. The Western ranges of the Olympics,
solid, dignified, and engraved against the
sky with their outline of peak and forest, came
into view, and yet his perturbation continued.</p>
<p>He saw the splendid panorama of Puget Sound
open to his view, and the train, at last, after those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
weary hours of jolting, rattled into the long sheds
that at that time disgraced the young giant city
of the North-west. It was the first time he had
even entered its shadows, and as he turned its
corner he looked curiously at the stump of a tree
that had been hollowed into an ample office, and
was assailed by the strident cries of cabmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Butler House,&rdquo; he said, relinquishing his
bag into the hands of the first driver who reached
him, and settled back into the cushions with a
sense of bewilderment, as if something long forgotten
had been recalled. He knew what it was
as he drove along in all that clamor of sound
which issues from a great and hurrying city. It
was New York, and he was in the young New
York of the North-west, with great skeleton structures
uprearing and the turmoil of building. Only
here was a difference, for side by side on the
streets walked men clad in the latest fashion, and
men bound to or coming from the arctic fields of
gold-bound Alaska. Electric cars tearing along
at a reckless speed, freight wagons heavily laden,
newsboys screaming the call of extras, and emerging
from behind log wagons, and everything
betokening that clash of the old and the intensely
new.</p>
<p>At the Butler House the man behind the desk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
twirled the register toward him, and assigned him
a room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sloan?&rdquo; he replied to Dick&rsquo;s inquiry. &ldquo;Oh,
yes. He&rsquo;s the old chap from New York who said
he was expecting someone, and to send him right
up. I suppose you&rsquo;re the man. Here, boy, show
Mr. Townsend to five-fifty. Right that way, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before his words were finished he had
turned to a new arrival.</p>
<p>The clamor of the streets, busy as is no other
city in the world busy when the season is on, was
still in his ears, striking a familiar note in his
memory, and the modernity of the elevator, the
brass-buttoned boy, and the hotel itself brought
back the last time he had seen Mr. Sloan, and the
day he had parted from his father in that office
on Wall Street. He found the Wall Street veteran
grayer, much older, and more kindly, when
he was ushered into the room to receive his greeting.
He subsided into a chair, but his father&rsquo;s
old-time friend protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;and turn
around, young fellow, so I can see whether you
have filled out. Humph! You&rsquo;ll do, I guess,
physically. I don&rsquo;t think I should want to have
any trouble with you. You look as if you could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
hold your own most anywhere. I&rsquo;m glad. Now,
sit down, and tell me all about the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened while Dick went into details of the
work, sparing none of the misfortunes and
disappointments, and telling of the new method
employed. He was interrupted now and then by
a shrewd question, an exclamation, or a word of
assent, and, after he had finished the account,
said: &ldquo;Well, that is all there is to report. What
do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Thomas W. Presby?&rdquo; Sloan&rsquo;s question
was abrupt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner of the Rattler, the mine next
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is?&rdquo; the question was explosive. &ldquo;Ah,
ha! The moth in the closet, eh? So that accounts
for it! I spent a hundred dollars, then, to good
purpose, it seems to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked an intent and wondering question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An agent here in Seattle wrote me that they
had written you, making an offer of sixty thousand
dollars for the property&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;the same one you
wrote me about. He said they had reason to believe
I was the financial backer for the mine, and
that they now wished to deal with me, inasmuch
as you might be carried away by youthful enthusiasm
to squandering my hard-earned cash. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
wrote back that your judgment satisfied me.
Then, just before I left, I got a flat offer of a hundred
thousand dollars for the property in full, or
seventy-five thousand for my share alone. It set
me to thinking, and wondering if some one wasn&rsquo;t
trying to cut your feet from under you. So, having
business in Portland, I came on up here, and
got after this agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had a chill of apprehension. He knew
before the loyal old man had proceeded half-way
what to expect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cost me a hundred dollars in entertainment,
and a lot of apparent readiness to talk business, to
get him confidential with me. Then I got the
name of the would-be purchaser, under injunctions
of secrecy, because those were the agent&rsquo;s positive
instructions. The man who wants to buy is
Presby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one black, unworthy instant, Dick looked
out of the window, wondering if it were possible
that Joan had known of her father&rsquo;s efforts, and
had withheld the information. Then the memory
of that gentle face, the candid eyes, her courageous
advice, and&ndash;&ndash;last of all&ndash;&ndash;the kiss and
prayer on her lips, made him mentally reproach
himself for the thought. But he remembered
that he still owed affection and deference to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
stanch old man who sat before him, who had been
his benefactor in an hour of need, and backed
faith with money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, turning to meet the kindly
eyes, &ldquo;what do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it? Think of it?&rdquo; Sloan replied,
raising his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you my answer. &lsquo;You
sit down,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and write this man Presby that
I knew no one in connection with the Croix d&rsquo;Or
but the son of the man who many times befriended
me, in desperate situations when I needed it!
That I was paying back to the son what I was unfortunately
prevented from paying back to the
father&ndash;&ndash;a constant gratitude! That I&rsquo;d see him
or any other man in their graves before I&rsquo;d sell
Richard Townsend out in that way. That I&rsquo;d
back Dick Townsend on the Croix d&rsquo;Or as long
as he wanted me to, and that when he gave that
up, I&rsquo;d still back him on any other mine he said
was good!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had lost his calm, club poise, and was again
the virulent business man of that Wall Street battle,
waged daily, where men must have force or
fail to survive. Dick saw in him the man who was,
the man who at times had shaken the financial
world with his desperate bravery and daring, back
in the days when giants fought for the beginnings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
of supremacy. He felt very inexperienced and
young, as he looked at this veteran with scars,
and impulsively rose to his feet and held out his
hand. He was almost dumb with gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked you to say so much,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I am&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;I am sort of down and
out with it all! I feel a little bit as I did when the
Cornell eleven piled on top of me in the annual,
when I played half-back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! And wasn&rsquo;t that a game!&rdquo; the old man
suddenly enthused, with sparkling eyes. &ldquo;And
how your father and I did yell and howl and beat
the heads of those in front! Gad! I remember
the old man had a silk hat, and he banged it up
and down on a bald head in front until there was
nothing but a rim left, and then looked as sheepish
as a boy caught stealing apples when he realized
what he had done. Oh, but your Daddy was
a man, even if he did have a temper, my boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes sparkled with a fervid love of the
game of his college days, and he seemed to have
dismissed the Croix d&rsquo;Or from his mind, as if it
were of no importance. Nor did he, during the
course of that visit, refer to it again. He made
exception, when he shook hands with Dick at the
train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anybody bluff you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
that a brave front alone often wins. If
you fail with the Croix the world is still big, and&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re
one of my legatees. Good-by.
Good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Dick endured the rumbling of trains
through long hours, the change from one to
another at small junctions, the day and night in a
stage coach whose springs seemed to have lost
resiliency, and the discourse of two drummers,
Hebraic, the chill aloofness of a supercilious mining
expert new to the district, and the heated discussions
of two drill runners, veterans, off to a
new field, and celebrating the journey with a demijohn.
The latter were union men, and long after
he was tired of their babel they broached a conversation
which brought Dick to a point of eager
listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you see,&rdquo; one of the men asserted;
&ldquo;they got the goods on him. Thompson had
been a good delegate until he got the finger itch,
then he had an idea he could use the miners&rsquo; union
to scratch &rsquo;em. He held up one or two small
mines before the big guns got wise. That got
him to feelin&rsquo; his oats, and he went for bigger
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did they get him?&rdquo; the other runner
insisted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They got him over here to where we&rsquo;re goin&ndash;&ndash;Goldpan.
He held up some fellers that&rsquo;s got
a mine called the Craw Door, or somethin&rsquo; like
that. Fetched three of his pals from Denver
with him. They called &rsquo;emselves miners! God!
Miners nothin&rsquo;! They&rsquo;d worked around Cripple
Creek long enough to get union cards, but two of
&rsquo;em was prize fighters, and the other used to be
bouncer at the old Alcazar when she was the hottest
place to lose money that ever turned a
crooked card. I remember there one time
when&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody asked you about that,&rdquo; growled the
other man. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m interested in is about
this big stiff, Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him? Oh, yes. Where was I? Well, he
fixed things for a hold-up. Was goin&rsquo; to get these
fellers at the Craw Door to untie their pokes, but
they don&rsquo;t stand for it. He packs a meetin&rsquo; with
a lot of swampers that don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about
the case, and before they gets done they votes a
strike, and an old feller from this Craw Door gets
his time. Gets kicked to death, the same as they
uster in Park City when the Cousin Jacks from
the Ontario cut loose on one another. The Denver
council takes cawgnizance of this, and investigates.
It snoops around till it gets the goods.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
Then&ndash;&ndash;<i>wow! bing!</i> goes this here Thompson.
They sue him themselves, and now he&rsquo;s up in
Ca&ntilde;on City, a-lookin&rsquo; plaintive like through these
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held his knotted, rough fingers open before
his face, and jerked his head sideways, simulating
a man peering through penitentiary bars. Then,
with a roar, he started in to bellow, &ldquo;The union
forever&ndash;&ndash;hooraw, boys hooraw!&rdquo; in which his
companion, forgetting all the story, joined until
it was again time to tilt the wicker-covered jug.</p>
<p>And so that was the end of Thompson and presumably
the strike, Dick thought, as he settled
back into the corner he had claimed. And it was
easy to see, with this damning evidence to be
brought forward, that Bells Park&rsquo;s murderers
would pay, to the full, the penalty. For them, on
trial, it meant nothing less than life. He was human
enough to be glad.</p>
<p>The stage rattled into Goldpan, and, stiff and
sore from his journey, he began his tramp toward
the trail of the cut-off leading homeward: He
stopped but once. It was in front of the High
Light, where a small scrap of paper still clung
to the plate glass. On it was written, in a hurried,
but firm and womanly, handwriting:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p>This place is closed for good. It is not for
sale. It has held hell. Hereafter it shall hold
nothing but cobwebs.</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Lily Meredith.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The date was that of the tragic night, the night
when Bells Park, fighting for those on whom he
had bestowed a queer, distorted affection, had
been kicked to death by the ruffians now cowering
in a distant jail!</p>
<p>Verily the camp and the district had memories
for him as he trudged away from its straggling
shanties, and filled his lungs with the fresh, free
air from the wide, rugged stretches beyond.
When he came through the borders of the Rattler
he looked eagerly, insistently, for a glimpse of his
heart&rsquo;s desire, and thought, with annoyance, that
he did not so much as know the cabin which she
called home. But he was not rewarded. It was
still the same, with no enlivening touch of form
or color, the same spider-web tramways debouching
into the top of the mill, the same sullen roar
and rumble of falling stamps, the same columns
of smoke from tall chimney and humble log structure,
alike, and the same careless clash of the
breakers.</p>
<p>Bill came hurrying down the trail to meet him,
waving his hat, and shouting a welcome. Up at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
the yard the smith held a black hand and muscled
arm up to shade his eyes from the last sunlight,
and then shook a hammer aloft. From the door
of the engine room the man who had been Bells&rsquo;
assistant bawled a greeting, and the fat cook
shook a ladle at him through the mess-house window.
It all gave him an immense and satisfactory
warmth of home-coming, and the Croix d&rsquo;Or,
with its steadfast, friendly little colony, was home
in truth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in sixty feet on the seven-hundred-foot,&rdquo;
Bill grinned, with the air of one giving
a pleasant surprise, &ldquo;and say, boy, we&rsquo;ve hit the
edge of ore. You were all right. The green
lead is still there, only she looks better to me
than she did before, and I know rock, some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing wanting in the pleasure of
his return, and the last addition to that satisfactory
day was a note he found, lying on the very
top of other letters awaiting him. It was from
Joan Presby, and Bill, starting to enter the office,
saw his partner&rsquo;s face in the light of the lamp,
smiled affectionately, and then tiptoed away into
the darkness, as if to avoid intrusion at such a
time.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>BENEFITS RETURNED</h3>
</div>
<p>Dick waited impatiently at the rendezvous,
saw Joan coming, hurried to meet her,
and was restrained from displaying his
joy by her upheld hand, as she smiled and cautioned:
&ldquo;Now, steady, Dick! You know we
were not to&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;be anything but comrades for
a while yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was compelled to respect her wishes, but
his eyes spoke all that his tongue might have uttered.
In the joy of meeting her, he had forgotten
the part played by her father in his surreptitious
attempt to gain possession of the Croix
d&rsquo;Or: but her first words reminded him of it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been terribly lonesome since you left.
I have felt as if the whole world had deserted me.
Dad is not a cheery sort of companion, because he
is so absorbed by the Rattler that he lives with it,
eats with it, sleeps with it. And, to make him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
worse, something appears to have upset him in the
last week or ten days until a bear would be a
highly lovable companion by comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She failed to notice the gravity of his face, for
he surmised how Sloan&rsquo;s answer must have affected
the owner of the Rattler, who strode mercilessly
over all obstacles and men, but now had
come to one which he could not surmount. He
wondered how obdurate Bully Presby would
prove if the time ever came when he dared ask
for Joan, and whether, if the father refused,
Joan&rsquo;s will would override this opposition.</p>
<p>Studying the lines of her face, and the firm contour
of her chin as it rounded into the grace of her
throat, he had a joyful sense of confidence that
she would not prove wanting, and dismissed Bully
Presby from his thoughts. With a great embarrassment,
he fumbled in the pocket of his shirt,
and brought out a little box which he opened, to
display a glittering gem. He held it toward her,
in the palm of his hand; but she pulled her gloves
over her fingers, and blushed and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;that you
have plenty of assurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I haven&rsquo;t made my mind up&ndash;&ndash;that
far, yet, and because if I had I shouldn&rsquo;t say so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
until the Croix d&rsquo;Or had been proven one way or
the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, awkwardly embarrassed, as if her
objection had conveyed a suggestion that his financial
standing had a bearing on her acceptance, and
hastened to rectify it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that its success or the money it would
bring has anything to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it failed?&rdquo; he interrogated, striving to
force her to an admission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should accept you as quickly as if it were a
success; perhaps more quickly, for I have money
enough. But that isn&rsquo;t it. Don&rsquo;t you see, can&rsquo;t
you understand, that I want you to make good just
to show that you can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered gloomily. &ldquo;But if I
didn&rsquo;t feel quite confident, I shouldn&rsquo;t offer you
the ring. And if I failed, I shouldn&rsquo;t ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you musn&rsquo;t fail,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;And,
do you know,&rdquo; she hastened, as if eager to change
the subject, and get away from such a trying pass,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve never seen the Croix since you took
possession of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; he said, with boyish eagerness.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted you to see what we are doing for
weeks&ndash;&ndash;yes, months. Will you? We can lead
your horse down over the trail easily.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>He walked by her side, the black patiently following
them, and told her of what had been accomplished
in his absence, and of their plans.
She listened gravely, offering such sage advice now
and then that his admiration of her knowledge
constantly increased. There were but few men in
sight as they crossed the head of the ca&ntilde;on, and
came slowly down past the blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if there isn&rsquo;t Mr. Clark!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
and the smith looked up, grinned, dropped
his tongs, and came toward them, wiping his
hand on his smudgy apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Joan!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit
bigger&rsquo;n you used to be, when I made iron rings
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Smuts,&rdquo; she laughed happily, stepping to
meet him, &ldquo;do you know I still have one, and that
it&rsquo;s in my jewel case, among my most precious
possessions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her white, clean hand, and he almost
seized it in his grimy, fist, then drew her
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Most forgot!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d
muss that up some if I took it in my fist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then muss it,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t
always so particular.&rdquo; And he grabbed, held,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
and patted the hand that he had known in its
childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, little Joan,&rdquo; he growled, with a suspicious
softness in his voice, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t changed
none since you used to sit on the end of that old-fashioned
forge, dirty up your pinafores, and cry
when Bully led you off. Him and me ain&rsquo;t friends
no more, so&rsquo;s you could notice. Seven years now
since I hit him for cussin&rsquo; me for somethin&rsquo; that
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t my fault! But, by gee whiz, old Bully
Presby could go some! We tipped an anvil over
that day, and wrecked a bellows before they
pulled us off each other. I&rsquo;ve always wondered,
since then which of us is the better man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with such an air of regret that Joan
and Dick laughed outright, and in the midst of it
a shadow came across their own, and they turned
to meet the amused, complacent stare of Bill. In
acknowledging the introduction, Joan felt that his
piercing eyes were studying her, probing her soul,
as appraisingly as if seeking to lay her appearance
and character bare. His harsh, determined face
suddenly broke into a wondrous warmth of smile,
and he impulsively seized her hand again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll do! You&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she knew intuitively that this giant of the
hills and lonely places had read her, with all her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
emotions and love, as he would read print, and
that, with the quick decision of such men, he was
prepared to give her loyal friendship and affection.</p>
<p>They walked slowly around the plant, Dick
pointing out their technical progress as they went,
and she still further gained Bill&rsquo;s admiration in
the assay-house when she declared that she had
a preference for another kind of furnace than
they were using.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, say, Miss Presby, can you assay?&rdquo; he
burst out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assay!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why, I lived in the
assay-house at two or three times, and then
studied it afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, up there!&rdquo; a shout came from the roadway
below.</p>
<p>They turned and went out to the little cindered,
littered level in front of the door, and looked
down to where, on the roadway a hundred feet
below, a man stood at the head of a string of panting
burros, and they recognized in him a packer
from Goldpan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; here for you.&rdquo; He waved
his hand back toward the string of burros.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Bill, turning to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it can be. I have ordered
nothing as heavy as that outfit appears to be.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>Perplexed, they excused themselves and descended
the slope, leaving Joan standing there in
front of the assay office, and enjoying the picture
of the ca&ntilde;on, with its border of working buildings
on one side, and its scattered cabins, mess- and
bunk-houses on the other, the huge waste dump
towering away from the hoist, and filling the head
of the ca&ntilde;on, and the sparkle of the stream
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you, all right,&rdquo; the packer insisted.
&ldquo;The Wells Fargo agent turned it over to me
down in Goldpan, and said the money had been
sent to pay me for bringin&rsquo; it up here. I don&rsquo;t
know what it is. It&rsquo;s stones of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still more perplexed, the partners ordered him
to take his pack train around to the storage house,
and Bill led the way while his partner climbed
back up the hill, and rejoined Joan. He was
showing her some of the assay slips from the
green lead when they heard a loud call from the
yard. It was Bill, beckoning. They went across
to meet him. One of the hitches had been thrown,
and the other burros stood expectantly waiting
to be relieved of their burdens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tombstone,&rdquo; Bill said gravely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
for Bell&rsquo;s grave. The express receipt shows that
it was sent by&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he hesitated for a moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
as if studying whether to use one name, or
another, and then concluded&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The Lily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a section of granite at their feet,
and on its polished surface they read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under this granite sleeps Bells Park, an engineer.
Murdered in defense of his employers.
Faithful when living, and faithful when dead, to
the Croix d&rsquo;Or and all those principles which
make a worthy man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sudden, overwhelming sadness seemed to
descend upon them. Bill turned abruptly, and
stepped across toward the boiler-house. The
whistle sent out a long-drawn, booming call&ndash;&ndash;the
alarm signal for the mine. In all the stress of
the Croix d&rsquo;Or it was the first time that note had
ever been used save in drill. The bells of the
hoist arose into a jangling clamor. They heard
the wheels of the cage whirl as it shot downward,
the excited exclamations of men ascending, some
of them with tools in hand, the running of a man&rsquo;s
feet, emerging from the blacksmith&rsquo;s tunnel, the
shout of the smith to his helper, and the labored
running of the cook and waiter across the cinders
of the yard. Bill slowly returned toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get you to land it up there,&rdquo;
he said, waving his arm toward the cross high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
above. &ldquo;Give us a hand here, will you? and we&rsquo;ll
throw this hitch again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire force of the mine had gathered
around them before he had finished speaking, and,
seeing the stone, understood. Joan caught her
riding skirts deftly into her hand, and, with Bill
leading the way up the steep and rock-strewn
ascent, they climbed the peak. The burros halted
now and then to rest, straining under the heaviness
of their task. The men of the Croix d&rsquo;Or sometimes
assisted them with willing shoulders pushing
behind, and there by the mound, on which flowers
were already beginning to show green and vivid,
they laid out the sections of granite. Only the
cook&rsquo;s helper was absent. Willing hands caught
the sections, which had been grooved to join, and,
tier on tier, they found their places until there
stood, high and austere, the granite shaft that told
of one man&rsquo;s loyalty.</p>
<p>Dick gave some final instructions as to the
rearranging of the grave and the little plot that
had been created around it, and they descended
in a strange silence, saddened by all that had been
recalled. No one spoke, save Bill, who gave
orders to the men to return to their tasks, and
then said, as if to himself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like mighty well
to know where Lily Meredith is. We cain&rsquo;t even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
thank her. Once I wondered what she was.
Now I know more than ever. She was all
woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to this, Joan, putting out her hand to bid
them good-by, assented.</p>
<p>The night shots had been fired at five o&rsquo;clock&ndash;&ndash;the
time usually selected by mines working two
shifts&ndash;&ndash;supper had been eaten, and the partners
were sitting in front of their quarters when Bill
again referred to Mrs. Meredith. High up on
the hill, where the new landmark had been,
erected, at the foot of the cross, the day shift of
the Croix d&rsquo;Or was busied here and there in
clearing away the ground around the grave of
the engineer, some of the men on hands and knees
casting aside small bowlders, others trimming a
clearing in the surrounding brush, and still others
painfully building a low wall of rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hard work of findin&rsquo; out where The Lily
is,&rdquo; said Bill softly, &ldquo;is because she covered her
trail. Nobody knows where she went. The stage
driver saw her on the train, but the railway agent
told him she didn&rsquo;t buy no ticket. The conductor
wrote me that he put her off at the junction, and
that she took the train toward Spokane. That&rsquo;s
all! It ends there as if she&rsquo;d got on the train,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
and then it had never stopped. We cain&rsquo;t even
thank her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, absorbed in thoughts of Joan, heard but
little of what he said, and so agreed with a short:
&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; And Bill subsided into
silence. A man came trudging up the path leading
from the roadway lower down, and in his hand
held a bundle of letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got the mail,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The stage may run
every other day after this, instead of twice a
week, the postmaster over at the camp told me.
Not much to-night. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed Dick a bundle of letters, and then,
sighting the others on the side of the peak above,
started to join them, and take his share in that
labor of respect and affection. In the approaching
twilight Dick ran through the packet, selected
one letter addressed to his partner, and gave it to
him, then tore open the first one at hand. It was
addressed in an unfamiliar and painful chirography,
with the postmark of Portland, Ore.,
stamped smudgily in its corner. He began casually
to read, then went white as the laborious
lines flowed and swam before his eyes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mister Townsend, owner of the cross
mine, I write you because I am afraid I aint got
your pardners name right and because Ive got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
something on my mind that I cant keep any more.
Im the girl that got burned at the High Light.
Your pardner saved my life and you were awful
kind to me. Everybody&rsquo;s been very kind to
me too. I spose you know I'll not be able to
work in dance halls no more because Im quite
ugly now with them scars all over my face. But
that dont make no difference. Mrs. Meredith
has been here to see me and told me who it was
saved my life. Mrs. Meredith dont want nobody
to know where shes gone. Shes not coming back
any more. Shes quit the business and is running
a sort of millinery store in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here a name had been painstakingly obliterated,
as if by afterthought, the very paper being
gouged through with ink.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shes paid all my hospital bills and when I get
strong enough shes going to let me go to work
for her. But that aint what Im writing about
and this letter is the biggest I ever wrote. The
nurse says Im making a book. I wasn&rsquo;t a very
bad girl or a very good girl when I was in the
camps. Maybe you know that but I done my best
and was as decent as I could be. There was a
man was my sweetheart and sometimes when he
drank too much he talked too much. Men always
say a whole lot when theyre full of rotgut, unless
they get nasty. My man never got nasty. Hes
gone away and I dont know where. Maybe he
dont want nothing more to do with me since I got
my face burned. Ive kept my mouth shut until I
found out it was you two men who saved me and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
Im writing this to pay you back the only way I
can. Bully Presby is stealing all his best pay ore
from the Croix d&rsquo;Or. Hes worked clean under
you and got the richest ledge in the district. They
aint nobody but confidential men ever get into
that drift. Hes been stealing that ore for going
on two years andll give you a lot of trouble if
you dont mind your Ps and Qs. I hope you beat
him out, and I pray for both of you.</p>
<p class='ralign'>Your ever grateful,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>WHEN REASON SWINGS</h3>
</div>
<p>Dick suddenly crumpled the sheet of paper,
and put it in his pocket. He lifted himself,
as a man distracted, from the chair
in which he had been sitting, gripping the arms
with hands that were tensely responding to an
agony of spirit. He almost lurched forward as
he stepped to the little steps leading down from
the porch, and into the worn trail, hesitated at
the forks leading to mess-house or assay office,
and then mechanically turned in the latter direction,
it being where the greater number of his
working hours were passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; the voice of his partner
called, as he plunged forward.</p>
<p>He had to make a determined attempt to speak,
then his voice broke, harsh and strained, through
dry lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assay office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not look back, but went forward, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
limp hands and tottering knees, turning neither to
right nor left. The whole world was a haze.
The steadfast mountain above him was a cynical
monster, and dimly, in the shadow of the high
landmark, he discerned a change, sinister, gloating,
and leering on him and his misery. The soft
voices of the men of the day shift returning from
their voluntary task, the staccato exhaust of the
hoisting engine bringing up a load of ore from the
refound lead, the clash of a car dumping its load
of waste, and the roar of the Rattler&rsquo;s stamps,
softened by distance, blended into discordance.</p>
<p>He entered the assay-house like a whipped dog
seeking the refuge of its kennel, threw himself
on a stool before the bench, leaned his head into
his hollowed arms, and groaned as would a
stricken warrior of olden days when surrendering
to his wounds.</p>
<p>This, then, explained it all&ndash;&ndash;that sequence of
events, frustrating, harrying, baffling him, since
the first hour he had come to the mine of the
Croix d&rsquo;Or. The rough suggestion of Bully
Presby on the first day, discouraging him; the
harsh attitude; the persistent attempts to dishearten
him and buy him out; the endeavor to
buy half the property from, and remove the backing,
of Sloan, without which he could not go on;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
the words of the watchman, who doubtless had
discovered Bully Presby&rsquo;s secret theft, blackmailed
him as much as he could, and, dying,
cursed him; but, hating the men of the mine
more, had withheld the vital meaning of his accusation.
Perhaps Presby had been instrumental in
Thompson&rsquo;s strike. But no, that could scarcely
be, although, in the light of other events in that
iniquitous chain, it might be possible. That he
had any part in the dynamiting of the dam or
power-house, Dick cast aside as unworthy of such
a man. The strong, hard, masterful, and domineering
face of Bully Presby arose before him
as from the darkening shadows of the room, and
it seemed triumphant.</p>
<p>He lifted his head suddenly, thinking, in his
superacute state of mind, that he had heard a
noise. He must have air! The assay office, with
its smell of nitric acid, its burned fumes, its clutter
of broken cupels and slag, was unbearable. He
arose from the stool so suddenly that it went
toppling over to fall against the stacked crucibles
beneath the bench which lent their clatter to the
upset. He stepped out into the night. It was
dark, only the stars above him dimly betraying
the familiar shapes of mountains, forests, and
buildings around. Up in the bunk-house some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
man was wailing a verse of &ldquo;Ella Re,&rdquo; accompanied
by a guitar, and the doleful drone of the
hackneyed chorus was caught up by the other men
&ldquo;off shift.&rdquo; But, nauseating as it was to him,
this piebald ballad of the hills, it contained one
shrieking sentence: &ldquo;Lost forevermore!&rdquo; That
was it! Joan was lost!</p>
<p>He looked up at the superintendent&rsquo;s quarters,
which had been his home, and saw that its lights
were out. Bill, he conjectured, always hard
working and early rising, had tumbled into his
bed, unconscious of this tragedy. He struck off
across the gulch, and took the trail he had so frequently
trodden with a beating heart, and high
and tender hope. It led him to the black barrier
of the pipe line, the place where first he had met
her, the sacred clump of bushes that had held
and surrendered to him the handkerchief
enshrined in his pocket, the slope where she had
leaned down from her horse and kissed him in
the only caress he had ever received from her
lips, and told him that he should be with her in
her prayers.</p>
<p>Reverently he caressed with his hands the spot
where she had so often sat on a gray old bowlder,
flat-topped. His heart cried for one more sight
of her, one more caress, one more opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
to listen to her voice before he dealt her the irrevocable
wound that would end it all.</p>
<p>Not for an instant did he waver. The tempter,
whispering in his ear, told him that he could conceal
his knowledge, advise Sloan to sell, take his
chance with Joan, and let the sleeping dog lie,
forever undiscovered. It told him that Sloan was
admittedly rich beyond his needs, and that with
him the Croix d&rsquo;Or was merely a matter of sentiment,
and an opportunity of bestowing on the
son of his old-time friend a chance to get ahead
in the world.</p>
<p>But back of it all came the inexorable voice of
truth, telling Dick that there was but one course
open, and that was reparation; that to his benefactor
he owed faith and loyalty; that Presby
must pay, though his&ndash;&ndash;Richard Townsend&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;castles
crumbled to dust in the wreckage of exposure.
He must break the heart and faith of
the girl who loved him, and whom, with every
fiber of his being, he loved in return.</p>
<p>She would stand in the world as the daughter
of a colossal thief! Not a thief of the marts,
where crookedness was confused with shrewdness
far removed from the theft of the hands;
but a thief who had burrowed beneath another
man&rsquo;s property, and carried away, to coinage, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
gold. Between Bully Presby and the man who
tunneled under a bank to loot the safe, there
was no moral difference save in the romance of
that mystic underground world where men bored
like microbes for their spoil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan! Joan! Joan!&rdquo; he muttered aloud,
as if she were there to hear his hurt appeal.</p>
<p>It was for her that he felt the wound, and not
for Bully Presby, her father. For the latter he
spared scant sympathy; but it was Joan who
would be stricken by any action he might take,
and the action must be taken, and would necessarily
be taken publicly.</p>
<p>Under criminal procedure men had served long
terms behind bars for less offenses than Presby&rsquo;s.
Others had made reparation through payment of
money, and slunk away into the shadows of disgrace
to avoid handcuffs. And the fall of Presby
of the Rattler, as a plunderer, was one that would
echo widely in the mining world where he had
moved, a stalwart, unbending king. Not until
then had Dick realized how high that figure towered.
Presby, the irresistible, a thief, and fighting
to keep out of the penitentiary, while Joan,
the brave, the loving, the true, cowered in her
room, dreading to look the world in the face.</p>
<p>And he, the man who loved her, almost accepted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
as her betrothed, with the ring even then
burning in his pocket, was the one who must deal
her this blow!</p>
<p>He got up and staggered through the darkness
along the length of the line, almost envying the
miserable dynamiter, who had died above the
remnant of wall, for the quiet into which he had
been thrust. If the train bringing him homeward
had been wrecked, and his life extinguished, he
could have saved her this. The Cross would have
been sold. She might have grieved for him, for
a time, but wounds will heal, unless too deep.
He stood above the abyss where daylight showed
ruins, and knew that the destruction of the dam,
heavy a blow as it had seemed when inflicted, was
nothing as compared to this ruin of dreams, of
love, and hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick! Dick! What is it, boy?&rdquo; came a
soft voice from the night, scarcely above a whisper.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me, old man? Ain&rsquo;t we
still pardners? Just as we uster be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He peered through the darkness, roused from
his misery in the stillness of the hour, and the
night, by the appeal. Dimly he discerned, seated
above him on the abutment, a shape outlined
against the stars. It threw itself down with hard-striking
feet, and came toward him, and he knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
it was not a phantom of misery. It came closer
to where he stood on the brink of the blackness,
and laid a hand on his shoulder, put it farther
across and held him, as tenderly as father might
have held, in this hour of distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been follerin&rsquo; you, boy,&rdquo; the kindly voice
went on. &ldquo;I saw that somethin&rsquo; had got you.
That you were hard hit! I&rsquo;ve been near you for
the last two or three hours. I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;d
have bothered you now, if I hadn&rsquo;t been afraid
you&rsquo;d fall over. Let&rsquo;s go back, Dick&ndash;&ndash;back to
the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if there had come to him in the
night a strong support. Numbed and despairing,
but with a strange relief, he permitted Bill to lead
him back over the trail, and at last, when they
were standing above the dim buildings below,
found speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for her sake that
I hate to do it. It&rsquo;s Joan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down here by me,&rdquo; the big voice, commiserating,
said. &ldquo;Here on this timber. I&rsquo;ve kept it
to myself, boy, but I know all about her. I stood
on the bank, where I&rsquo;d just gone to hunt you, on
that day she reached down from the saddle. I
knew the rest, and slipped away. You love her.
She&rsquo;s done somethin&rsquo; to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the denial was emphatic. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t!
She&rsquo;s as true as the hills. It&rsquo;s her father. Look
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fumbled in his pocket, pulled out the
crumpled sheet, and struck a match. Bill took the
letter in his hands and read, while the night itself
seemed pausing to shield the flickering flame.
With hurried fingers he struck another match, and
the light flared up, exposing his frowning eyebrows,
the lights in his keen eyes, the tight pressure
of his firm lips.</p>
<p>He handed the letter back, and for a long time
sat silently staring before him, his big, square
shoulders bent forward, and his hat outlined
against the light of the night, which was steadily
increasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see how it is,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s
hard on you, isn&rsquo;t it, boy? A man can stand anything
himself, but it&rsquo;s hell to hurt those we care
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sympathy of his voice cut like a knife, with
its merciful hurt. Dick broke into words, telling
of his misery, but stammering as strong men stammer,
when laying bare emotions which, without
pressure, they always conceal. His partner listened,
motionless, absorbing it all, and his face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
was concealed by the darkness, otherwise a great
sympathy would have flared from his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find a way out of this, Dick,&rdquo; he
said at last, with a sigh. And the word &ldquo;we&rdquo;
betrayed more fully than long sentences his compassion.
&ldquo;We must go slow. Somehow, I
reckon, I&rsquo;m cooler than you in this kind of a try-out.
Maybe because it don&rsquo;t hit me so close to
home. Let&rsquo;s go back, boy, back to the cabin, and
try to rest. The daylight is like the Lord&rsquo;s own
drink. It clears the head, and makes us see things
better than we can in the night&ndash;&ndash;when all is dark.
Let&rsquo;s try to find a way out, and try to forget it
for a while. Did you ever think how good it all
is to us? Just the night, coming along every once
in a while, to make us appreciate how good the
sun is, and how bright the mornings are. It ain&rsquo;t
an easy old world, no matter how hard we try
to make it that; because it takes the black times
to make our eyes glad to watch the sunrise. Let
me help you, old pardner. We&rsquo;ve been through
some pretty tight places together, and somehow,
when He got good and ready, the Lord always
showed us a way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose on his feet, stretched his long muscular
arms, and started down the hill, and Dick
followed. There was not another word exchanged,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
other than the sympathetic &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;
in which they had not failed for more than
seven years, and outside the stars waned slowly,
the stamp mill of the Rattler roared on, and the
Croix d&rsquo;Or was unmoved.</p>
<p>The daylight came, and with it the boom of
the night shift setting off its morning blasts, and
clearing the way for the day shift that would follow
in sinking the hole that must inevitably betray
the dishonesty of the stern mine master at the
foot of the hill. Dick had not slept, and turned
to see a shadow in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get up, Dick,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;Just
try to rest. I heard you tumblin&rsquo; around all the
night. You don&rsquo;t get anywhere by doin&rsquo; that.
A man has to take himself in hand more than
ever when there&rsquo;s big things at stake. Then&rsquo;s
when he needs his head. You just try to get some
rest. I&rsquo;ll keep things goin&rsquo; ahead all right, and
there ain&rsquo;t no call to do nothin&rsquo; for a week or
ten days&ndash;&ndash;till we get our feet on the ground.
After that we&rsquo;ll find a trail. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the kindly tones there ran confidence,
and, entirely exhausted, Dick turned over and
tried to sleep. It came to him at last, heavy and
dreamless, the sleep that comes beneficently to
those who suffer. The sun, creeping westward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
threw a beam across his face, and he turned restlessly,
like a fever-stricken convalescent, and
rolled farther over in the bed.</p>
<p>The beam pursued him, until at last there was
no further refuge, and he sat up, dazed and bewildered,
and hoping that all had been a nightmare,
and that he should hear the cheery note of the
whistle telling him that it was day again, and
calling the men of the Croix d&rsquo;Or to work.</p>
<p>It was monstrous, impossible, that all should
have changed. It was but yesterday that he had
returned to the mine with finances assured, confidence
restored, and the certainty that Joan Presby
loved him, and could come to his side when his
work was accomplished.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch and the bar of sunlight.
It was four o&rsquo;clock, and the day was gone. Everything
was real. Everything was horrible. He
crawled stiffly from his bed, thrust his head into
the cold water of the basin, and, unshaven,
stepped out to the porch and down the trail.</p>
<p>The plumes of smoke still wreathed upward
from two stacks. Bill was still driving downward
unceasingly. The mellow clang of the smith&rsquo;s
hammer, sharpening drills, smote his ears, and
the rumble of the cars. The cook, in a high, thin
tenor, sang the songs with which he habitually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
whiled away his work. Everything was the same,
save him! And his air castles had been blown
away as by the wind.</p>
<p>In a fever of uncertainty, he stood on the hillside
and thought of what he should do. He believed
that it was his duty to be the one to break
the harsh news to Joan, and wondered whether
or not she might be found at the tryst. He
remembered that, once before when he had not
appeared, she had ridden over there in the afternoon.
Perhaps, expecting him, and being disappointed,
she might be there again.</p>
<p>He hurried down the slope, and back up across
the divide and along the trail, his hopes and uncertainties
alone rendering him certain that she
must be there, and paused when the long, black
line shone dully outlined in its course around the
swelling boss of the hill. He experienced a thrill
of disappointment when he saw that she was not
waiting, and, again consulting his watch feverishly,
tramped backward and forward along the
confines of the hallowed place.</p>
<p>At last, certain from the fresh hoof marks on
the yielding slope, that she had come and gone,
he turned, and went slowly back to the mine. He
had a longing to see his partner, and learn
whether or not Mathews, with that strange, resourceful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
logic of his, had evolved some way out
of the predicament. But Bill was nowhere in
sight. He was not in the office, and the mill door
was locked. The cook had not seen him; and the
blacksmith, busy, stopped only long enough to say
that he thought he had seen the superintendent
going toward the hoisting-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Bill?&rdquo; Dick asked of the
engineer, who stood at his levers, and waited for
a signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s below,&rdquo; the engineer answered, throwing
over an arm, and watching the cage ascend
with a car of ore.</p>
<p>It trundled away, and Dick stepped into the
cage. The man appeared irresolute, and embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be up pretty soon, I think,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll not wait for him,&rdquo; Dick said.
&ldquo;Lower away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man still stood, irresolute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go, I said,&rdquo; Dick called sharply, his
usual patience of temper having gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; halted the engineer. &ldquo;Bill
said to me, when he went down, says he: &lsquo;You
don&rsquo;t let any one come below. Understand? I
don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s Townsend himself. Nobody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
comes down. You hold the cage, because I&rsquo;ll send
the shift up, and &lsquo;tend to the firing myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Dick was enraged by this stubbornness,
and turned with a threat, and said:
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s running this mine? I don&rsquo;t care what
he said. You haven&rsquo;t understood him. Lower
away there, I say, and be quick about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rails and engine room slid away from him.
The cage slipped downward on its oiled bearings,
as if reluctant, and the light above faded away
to a small pin-point below, and then died in
obscurity, as if the world had been blotted out.
Only the sense of falling told him that he was
going down, down, to the seven-hundred-foot
level, and then he remembered that he had no
candle. The cage came to a halt, and he fumbled
for the guard bar, lifted it, and stepped out.</p>
<p>Straight ahead of him he saw a dim glow of
light. With one hand on the wall he started
toward it, approached it, and then, in the hollow
of illumination saw something that struck him
like a blow in the face. The hard, resounding
clash of his heels on the rock underfoot stopped.
His hands fell to his sides, as if fixed in an attitude
of astonishment. Standing in the light
beyond him stood Joan, with her hands raised,
palms outward.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Stop! Stay
where you are a moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazed and bewildered, he obeyed mechanically,
and comprehended rather than saw that,
crouched on the floor of the drift beyond, his
partner knelt with a watch in his hand, and in a
listening attitude. Suddenly, as if all had been
waiting for this moment, a dull tremor ran
through the depths of the Croix d&rsquo;Or. A
muffled, beating, rending sound seemed to tear
its way, vibrant, through the solid ledge. He
leaped forward, understanding all at once, as if
in a flash of illumination, what the woman he
loved and his partner had been waiting for. It
was the sound of the five-o&rsquo;clock blasts from the
Rattler, as it stole the ore from beneath their
feet. It was the audible proof of Bully Presby&rsquo;s
theft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan! My Joan!&rdquo; he said, leaping forward.
&ldquo;I should have spared you this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she did not answer. She was leaning back
against the wall of the tunnel, her hands outstretched
in semblance of that cross whose name
was the name of the mine&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;as if crucified on
its cross of gold. The flaring lights of the candles
in the sticks, thrust into the crevices around,
lighted her pale, haggard face, and her white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
hands that clenched themselves in distress. She
looked down at the giant who was slowly lifting
himself from his knees, with his clear-cut face
upturned; and the hollows, vibrant with silence,
caught her whispered words and multiplied the
sound to a sibilant wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true! You didn&rsquo;t
lie! You told the truth! My father&ndash;&ndash;my father
is a thief, and may God help him and me!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE BULLY MEETS HIS MASTER</h3>
</div>
<p>The ache and pain in her whole being was
no greater than the colossal desire Dick
had to comfort and shield her. He
rushed toward her with his arms reached out
to infold, but she pushed him back, and said
hoarsely: &ldquo;No! No! I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t let you! It would
be an insult now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were filled with a light he had never
seen in them before, a commanding flame that
held him in check and stupefied him, as he tried
to reason why his love at that moment would be
an insult. It did not dawn on him that he was
putting himself in the position of one who was
proffering silence for affection. All he knew was
that everything in the world seemed against him,
and, overstrained to the breaking point, he was
a mere madman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought her here?&rdquo; he hoarsely questioned
Bill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And told her that her father was under us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that I was to be kept above ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, and I had a reason, because&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish the sentence. The younger
man shouted a furious curse, and lunged forward
and struck at the same time. His feet, turning
under a fragment of rock, twisted the directness
of his blow so that it lost force; but its heavy
spat on the patient face before him was like the
crack of a pistol in that underground chamber.</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s hands lifted impulsively, and then
dropped back to his sides, hanging widely open.
The flickering candlelight showed a slow red
stream emerging slowly from one of his nostrils,
and running down across the firm chin, and the
pain-distorted lips. In his eyes was a hurt agony
of reproach, as if the knife of a friend had been
unexpectedly thrust into his heart. Dick&rsquo;s arm,
tensed by the insane anger of his mind, was drawn
back to deal another blow, and seemed to stop
half-way, impotent to strike that defenseless face
before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you hit again, boy? I&rsquo;ll not strike
back! I have loved you too much for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a world of misery and reproach in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
the quiet voice of the giant, whose tremendous
physical power was such that he could have
caught the younger man&rsquo;s arm, and with one
wrench twisted it to splintered bone. Before its
echoes had died away another voice broke in,
suffused with anguish, the shadows waving on the
walls of gray rock twisted, and Joan&rsquo;s hands
were on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick! Dick! Are you mad? Do you
know what you are doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook her hands from his arm, reeled
against the wall, and raised his forearm across
his eyes, and brushed it across, as if dazed and
blinded by a rush of blood which he would sweep
away. He had not noticed that in that staggering
progress he had fallen full against a candlestick,
and that it fell to the floor and lay there
between them, with its flame slowly increasing as
it formed a pool of grease. For the first time
since he had spoken, the huge miner moved. He
stepped forward, and ground the flame underfoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be a stray cap around here
somewhere,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>His voice appeared to rouse the younger man,
and bring him to himself. He stepped forward,
with his hands behind him and his face still set,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
wild and drawn, and said brokenly: &ldquo;Bill! Bill!
Strike back! Do something! Old friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; came the reply, in a helpless monotone.
&ldquo;You know if it were any other man I&rsquo;d
kill him! But you don&rsquo;t understand yet, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made him bring me here,&rdquo; Joan said,
coming closer, until the shadows of the three were
almost together. Her voice had a strange hopelessness
in it, and yet a calm firmness. &ldquo;He came
to talk it over with me, on your account.
Pleading your cause&ndash;&ndash;begging me that, no matter
what happened, I should not change my attitude
toward you. Toward you, I say! He said your
sense of honesty and loyalty to Sloan would drive
you to demanding restitution even though it broke
your heart. He said he loved you more than
anything on earth, and begged me to help him
find some way to spare&ndash;&ndash;not me, or my father&ndash;&ndash;but
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick tried to speak, but his throat restricted
until he clutched it with his fingers, and his lips
were white and hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not believe that what he said was true,&rdquo;
the voice went on, coming as from depths of desolation
and misery, and with dead levels dulled by
grief beyond emotion. &ldquo;I have believed in my
father! I thought there must be some mistake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
I demanded of your partner that he lay off his
own shift, and bring me here where we might
listen. Oh, it was true&ndash;&ndash;it was true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She suddenly turned and caught the steel handle
of a candlestick in her hand, and tore its long steel
point from the crevice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve found the way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
found the way. You must come with me&ndash;&ndash;now!
Right now, I say. We shall have this over with,
and then&ndash;&ndash;and then&ndash;&ndash;I shall go away from here;
for always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; Dick said, holding his hands
toward her. &ldquo;Not that, Joan! What are you
going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to my father. He, too, must be
spared. He must give it back. It must never
be known. I must save him disgrace. It must
be done to-night&ndash;&ndash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started down the drift toward the cage,
walking determinedly, and Dick&rsquo;s lips opened
again to beg her to come back; but Bill&rsquo;s hand was
on his shoulder, and his grave and kindly voice in
his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go with her, boy. She&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s the only
way. Have it over with to-night. If you don&rsquo;t
you&rsquo;ll break her heart, as well as your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed her to the cage, and the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
miner gave the hoisting bell. The cage floated
upward, and into the pale twilight. Heedless of
anything around, they walked across the yard,
and turned into the roadway leading down the
gulch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo; she asked, turning toward
Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not needed.
Besides, I couldn&rsquo;t stand another blow to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the only reference he ever made to it,
but it went through Dick with more pain than he
had administered. Almost sullenly he followed
her down the road, wordless, bewildered, and
despairing. Unable to spare her, unable to shield
her, unable to comfort her, and unable to be other
than true to his benefactor, he plodded after her
into the deeper shadows of the lower gulch, across
the log bridge spanning the brawling mountain
stream, and up into the Rattler camp. Her steps
never faltered as she advanced straight to the
office door, and stepped inside.</p>
<p>The bookkeepers were gone, and the inner door
ajar. She threw it open, walked in, and closed it
after Dick, who sustained a deadly anger against
the man who sat at his desk, and as they entered
looked up with a sharp stare of surprise.</p>
<p>Something in the attitude of the two appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
to render him more alert, more hard, more uncompromising
and he frowned, as Dick had seen him
frown before when angry men made way for him
and his dominant mastery. His daughter had
stopped in front of the closed door, and eyed him
with eyes no less determined than his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your men are working under the Croix
d&rsquo;Or,&rdquo; she said coldly, without wasting words in
preliminary.</p>
<p>His face hardened instantly, and his eyes
flamed, dull and defiant. The lines of his heavy
jaw appeared to deepen, his shoulders lifted a
trifle, as if the muscles of him had suddenly tensed
for combat, and his lips had a trace of the
imperious sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re certain of that, are you, my girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I was in their lower
level when the Rattler&rsquo;s shots were fired. I heard
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant he seemed about to leap from
his chair, and then, recovering himself, said with
sarcastic emphasis, and a deadly calmness: &ldquo;And
pray what were you doing there? Was the young
mine owner, Townsend, there with you? Was
he so kind&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any need for an exchange of
insults?&rdquo; Dick demanded, taking a step toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
him, and prevented from going farther only by
recollection of his previous loss of temper.</p>
<p>For an instant the mine owner defiantly met his
look, and then half-rose from his chair, and
stared more coldly across the litter of papers,
plans, and impedimenta on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are you here together?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you man enough to come
yourself, instead of taking my daughter underground?
Did you want to compel her to be the
chief witness in your claim? What right had you
to&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; admonished Joan&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>It served a double purpose, for had she not
interrupted Dick might have answered with a
heat that he would have regretted, and Bully
Presby dropped back into his chair, and drummed
with his fingers on the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took the ore. You must pay. You
must!&rdquo; went on the dull voice of his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how should I know how much it amounts
to, even if I do find out that some of my men
drove into the Cross pay?&rdquo; he answered, fixing
her with his flaming eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must know,&rdquo; she insisted dully. &ldquo;I
know you know. I know you knew where the ore
was coming from. It must be paid back.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>For an instant they eyed each other defiantly,
and her brave attitude, uncompromising, seemed
to lower the flood-gates of his anger. His cheeks
flushed, and he lowered his head still farther, and
stared more coldly from under the brim of his
square-set hat. There were not many men who
would have faced Bully Presby when he was in
that mood; but before him stood his daughter,
as brave and uncompromising as he, and fortified
by something that he had allowed to run dwarf
in his soul&ndash;&ndash;a white conscience, burning undimmed,
a true knowledge of what was right and
what was wrong. Her inheritance of brain and
blood had all the strength of his, and her fearlessness
was his own. She did not waver, or bend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be paid back,&rdquo; she reiterated, a little
more firmly.</p>
<p>He suddenly jerked himself to his feet, his tremendous
shoulders thrust forward across the desk,
and raised his hand with a commanding finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan,&rdquo; he ordered harshly, &ldquo;you get out of
here. Go to your room! Leave this affair to
this man and me. This is none of your business.
Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not!&rdquo; she defied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is best,&rdquo; Dick said, taking a step
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
toward her. &ldquo;I can take care of my own and
Mr. Sloan&rsquo;s interests. Please go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Joan&rdquo; almost slipped from his
lips. She faced him, and backed against the
door. &ldquo;Yours and Mr. Sloan&rsquo;s interests? What
of mine? What of my conscience? What of
my own father? What of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped hastily to the desk, and tapped on
it with her firm fingers, and faced the mine master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you must pay!&rdquo; she declared, her voice
rising and trembling in her stress. &ldquo;And you
must! You shall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was in a fury of temper by now, and
brought the flat of his heavy, strong hand down
on its top, sending the inkwell and the electric
stand lamp dancing upward with a bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall do as I please!&rdquo; he roared.
&ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t please me to pay until these
men&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and between the words he brought his
hand down in heavy emphasis&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;until&ndash;&ndash;these&ndash;&ndash;men&ndash;&ndash;of
the Cross mine prove it! I&rsquo;ll make
them get experts and put men in my mine, and put
you yourself on the stand before I&rsquo;ll give them one
damned dollar! I&rsquo;ll fight every step of the road
before I&rsquo;ll lay my hand down. I&rsquo;ll pay nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood there above him, fixing him with her
clear, honest, accusing eyes, and never faltered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
Neither his words nor his rage had altered her
determination. She was like a statue of justice,
fixed and demanding the right. Dick had rushed
forward to try and dissuade her from further
speech, and stood at the end of the desk in the
halo of light from the lamp, and there was a tense
stillness in the room which rendered every
outward sound more distinct. The voice of a
boy driving mules to their stable and singing as
he went, the clank and jingle of the chain tugs
across the animals&rsquo; backs, and the ceaseless monotone
of the mill, all came through the open windows,
and assailed their ears in that pent moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me have my way,&rdquo; Joan said, turning
to Dick, and in her voice was infinite sorrow
and tragedy. &ldquo;It is more my affair than yours
now. Father, I shall not permit you to go any
farther. It is useless. I know! I can&rsquo;t do it!
I can&rsquo;t keep the money you gave me. It isn&rsquo;t
mine! It is theirs! You say you will not pay.
Well, then, I shall, to the last dollar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall accept nothing&ndash;&ndash;not a cent&ndash;&ndash;from
you, if we never get a penny from the Cross!&rdquo;
declared Dick, half-turning, as if to end the interview.</p>
<p>She did not seem to hear him. She was still
facing the hard, twisting face of Bully Presby,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
who had suddenly drawn back, as if confronted by
a greater spirit than his own. She went on speaking
to him as if Dick was not in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stole their ore. You know you stole it.
Somehow, it all hurts so that I cannot put it in
words; for, Dad, I have loved you so much&ndash;&ndash;so
much! Oh, Dad! Dad! Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped to her knees, as if collapsed, to the
outer edge of the desk, and her head fell forward
on her hands. The unutterable wail of her voice
as she broke, betrayed the desperate grief of her
heart, the destruction of an idol. It was as if
she told the man across the desk that he had been
her ideal, and that his actions had brought this
ruin about them; as if all the sorrows of the
world had cumulated in that ruin of faith.</p>
<p>Dick looked down at her, and his nails bit into
his palms as he fought off his desire to reach down
and lift her to his arms. Bully Presby&rsquo;s chair
went clashing back against the wall, where he
kicked it as he leaped to his feet. He ran around
the end of the desk, throwing Dick aside as he
did so with one fierce sweep of his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; he said brokenly, laying his hand on
her head. &ldquo;Joan! My little Joan! Get up,
girl, and come here to your Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not move. The excess of her grief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
was betrayed by her bent head and quivering
shoulders. The light, gleaming above her, threw
stray shadows into the depths of her hair, and
softened the white, strained tips of her fingers.</p>
<p>Bully Presby, the arrogant and forceful, still
resting his hand on her head, turned toward the
twisted, youthful face of the man at his side,
whose fingers were now clenched together, and
held at arm&rsquo;s length in front of him. The mine
owner seemed suddenly old and worn. The invincible
fire of his eyes was dulled to a smoldering
glow, as if, reluctantly, he were making way for
age. His broad shoulders appeared suddenly to
have relinquished force and might. He stooped
above her, as if about to gather her into his arms,
and spoke with the slow voice of pathos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right! I
should pay; and I will! But I did it for her. She
was all I had. I&rsquo;ve starved for her, and worked
for her, and stolen for her! Ever since her
mother died and left her in my arms, I&rsquo;ve been
one of those carried away by ambition. God is
damning me for it, in this!&rdquo; He abruptly
straightened himself to his old form, and gestured
toward the sobbing girl at his feet. &ldquo;I am paying
more to her than as if I&rsquo;d given you the Rattler
and all&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;everything!&ndash;&ndash;for the paltry ore I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
pulled from under your feet. You shall have your
money. Bully Presby&rsquo;s word is as good as his
gold. You know that! I don&rsquo;t know anything
about you. I don&rsquo;t hate you, because you are
fighting for your own! Somehow I feel as if the
bottom had been knocked out of everything, all
at once! I wish you&rsquo;d go now. I want to have
her alone&ndash;&ndash;I want to talk to her&ndash;&ndash;just the way
I used to, before&ndash;&ndash;before&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had gone to the limit. His strong hands
knotted themselves as they clenched, then unclenched
as he stepped to the farther side of the
door and looked at Dick, who had not moved;
but now, as if his limitations also had been
reached, the younger man leaned forward,
stooped, and his arms caught Joan and lifted her
bodily to his breast. In slow resignation, and
with a sigh as if coming to shelter at last, her arms
lifted up, her hands swept round his shoulders,
and came to rest, clasped behind his head, and
held him tightly, as if without capitulation.</p>
<p>There was a gasp of astonishment, and the
rough pine floor creaked as Bully Presby,
dumbfounded, comprehending, conquered, turned
toward the door. He opened it blindly, fumbling
for the knob with twitching hands&ndash;&ndash;hands unused
to faltering. He looked back and hesitated, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
if all his directness of life, all his fierce decision
of character had become undermined, irresolute.
He opened his lips as if to protest, to demand,
to dominate, to plead for a hearing; but no sound
came. His face, unobserved by either the man he
had robbed, or the daughter who had arraigned
him, betrayed all these struggling, conflicting
emotions. He was whipped! He was beaten
more certainly than by fists. He was spiritually
and physically powerless. Dazed, bewildered, he
stood for an instant, then his heavy hands, which
for the first time in his life had been held out in
mute appeal, dropped to his sides. Habit only
asserted when he slammed the door behind him
as he walked out into the lonely darkness of the
accusing night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE QUEST SUPREME</h3>
</div>
<p>It was twilight again, and such a twilight as
only the Blue Mountains of that far divide
may know. It barred the west with golden
bands, painted lavish purples and mauves in the
hollows, and reddened the everlasting snows on
the summits. It deepened the greens of the tamaracks,
and made iridescent the foams of the
streams tearing downward joyously to the wide
rivers below. It painted the reddish-yellow bars
of the cross on the peak above the Croix d&rsquo;Or,
and rendered its outlines a glorified symbol. It
lent stateliness to the finger of granite beneath the
base that told those who paused that beneath the
shaft rested one who had a loyal heart. It
swooped down and lingered caressingly on the
strong, tender face of the girl who sat on the wall
surrounding the graves of Bells Park and &ldquo;the
best woman that ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;For some reason,&rdquo; Joan said, speaking to
the two men beside her, &ldquo;the ugliness of some of
it has gone. There is nothing left but the good
and the beautiful. Ah, how I love it&ndash;&ndash;all! All!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s arm slipped round her, and drew her
close, and unresisting, to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And but for you and Bill,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;it
might never have ended this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; drawled the deep voice of the
grizzled old miner. &ldquo;Things is just the way they
have to be. Nobody can change &rsquo;em. The Lord
Almighty fixes &rsquo;em, and I expect they have to work
out about as He wants &rsquo;em to. Somehow, up
here in the tops of the hills, where it&rsquo;s close to the
sky, He seems a heap friendlier and nearer than
He does down on the plains. &rsquo;Most always I
feel sorry for them poor fellers that live down
there. They seem like such lonesome, forgotten
cusses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youthful couple by him did not answer.
Their happiness was too new, too sacred, to admit
of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Bill went on argumentatively, &ldquo;me
and Bully Presby are friends. He likes me for
standin&rsquo; up for my own, and told me so to-day.
He ain&rsquo;t got over that feller Wolff yet. Says
he could have killed him when he found out Wolff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
had poisoned the water and rolled the bowlder
into the shaft to pen us in. I reckon Wolff tried to
blackmail him about what he knew, but the Bully
didn&rsquo;t approve none of the other things. That
ain&rsquo;t his way of fightin&rsquo;. You can bet on that!
He drifted over and got the green lead in the
Cross, when others had given it up and squandered
money. That shows he was a real miner.
We come along, and&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;all he&rsquo;s done is just
to help us find it, and then hand over the proceeds,
all in the family, as I take it. Nobody&rsquo;s loser.
The families gets tangled up, and instead of there
bein&rsquo; two there&rsquo;s just one. The Rattler and the
Croix d&rsquo;Or threatens to be made into one mine,
and the two plants consolidated to make it more
economical. The green lead&rsquo;s the best ledge in
the Blue&rsquo;s, and &rsquo;most everybody seems to be gettin&rsquo;
along pretty well. That ain&rsquo;t luck. It&rsquo;s God
Almighty arrangin&rsquo; things for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat for a moment, and gave a long sigh,
as if there were something else in his mind that
had not been uttered. Dick lifted his eyes, and
looked at him affectionately, and then whispered
into the ear close by his shoulder: &ldquo;Shall I tell
him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; Joan said, drawing away from him,
and looking expectantly at the giant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>Dick fumbled in his pocket with a look of sober
enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, Bill,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I got a letter
from Sloan a few days ago. Here it is. Read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter took it, and frowning as he opened
it, held it up to catch the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Gives the
Croix d&rsquo;Or to you. Says he wants you to have
it, because you&rsquo;re the one that made good on it,
and he don&rsquo;t need the money! That the deeds
are on the way by registered mail, and all he asks
is a small bar from the first clean-up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He folded the letter, and held it in his hands,
looking thoughtfully off into the distance for a
time while he absorbed the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a rich man!
Richer&rsquo;n I ever expected you&rsquo;d be; but I&rsquo;m a selfish
old feller, after all! It seems to me as if we ain&rsquo;t
never goin&rsquo; to be the same again, as we uster be
when all we had was a sack of flour and a side
of bacon, and the whole North-west to prospect.
It seems as if somethin&rsquo; mighty dear has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick got up and stood before him, with his
hands in his pockets, and smiling downward into
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of that, too, Bill,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
I can&rsquo;t afford to lose you. I&rsquo;d rather lose the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
Cross. So I&rsquo;ll tell you something that I told
Joan, long ago&ndash;&ndash;that if ever the mine made good,
and I could give you something beside a debt, you
were to have half of what I made. A few days
ago it would have been a quarter interest you
owned. Now it is a half. We&rsquo;re partners still,
Bill, just as we were when there was nothing but
a sack of flour and a side of bacon to divide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at him, expecting him to show
some sign of excitement, but he did not. Instead,
he reached over, and painstakingly pulled a
weed from the foot of the wall, and threw it
away. He cleared his throat once or twice,
but did not look at them, and then got to his feet
and started as if to go down to the camp. Then,
as if his feelings were under control again, came
back, and took one of Joan&rsquo;s and one of Dick&rsquo;s
hands into his own toil-worn palms, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Dick! It&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n I deserve, this
knowin&rsquo; both of you, and havin&rsquo; you give me a
share in the Cross! And I accept it; but conditionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped their hands, and turned to look
around, as if seeing a very broad world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the condition?&rdquo; Joan asked, laying
her hand on his arm, and looking up at him.
&ldquo;Can we change it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve had a hard
hit of my own for a long time now. I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo;
to try to heal it. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; away on what may be
a short, or a long, long trail.&rdquo; His voice dropped
until it was scarcely audible. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; away to
keep goin&rsquo; till I find The Lily. And when I find
her, I&rsquo;ll come back, and bring her with me, if
she&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his back toward them, unbuttoned
the flap of his flannel shirt, and reached inside.
He drew out a sheet of paper wrapped in an old
silk handkerchief, as if it were a priceless possession
to be carefully preserved, and held it
toward them. He did not look at either of them
as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got that a long time ago,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
somehow I could never say anything about it to
any one. And I reckon you&rsquo;re the only two in the
world that&rsquo;ll ever see it. Read it and give it
back to me when&ndash;&ndash;when you come down the
mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and stalked away over the trail, his
feet planting themselves firmly, as he had walked
through life with firmness.</p>
<p>They watched him go, and opened the letter,
and read, in a high, strong handwriting:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear Mr. Mathews</span>: I am writing you of
business, for one thing, and because I feel that I
must, for another. I have paid for a tombstone
suitable for Bells Park, whom I esteemed more
than I have most men. And I have paid for its
delivery to you, knowing that you will have it
mounted in place. So you must pay nothing for
it in any form, as I wish to stand all the expense
in memory of an old and tried friend. I have left
Goldpan for good and all, and all those old associations
of my life. I am starting over again,
to make a good and clean fight, in clean surroundings.
I am sick to death of all that has made up
my life. I am bitter, knowing that I was handicapped
from the start. My father educated me
because it was easier to have me in a boarding
school in all my girlhood than to have me with
him. I never knew my mother. I had no love
bestowed upon me in my girlhood. When I came
of age my father, who was an adventurer of the
discredited gentleman type, gave me to a friend
of his. I learned a year after I had been married
that I had been sold to my husband&ndash;&ndash;God save
the mark! I tried to be patient when he
dragged me from camp to camp, and I want to
say that whatever else I have been, I have been
good. You understand me, I hope, because I am
defending myself to you, the only living being for
whose esteem I care. I have had two happy
moments in my life&ndash;&ndash;one when the news was
brought me that my husband had shot himself
across a gambling table, and the second when you
faced me that night after Bells Park was killed,
alone there in the street after your partner had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
gone on, and said: &ldquo;Lily, it hurts you as it does
me. You&rsquo;re on the level, little pal. I want to
stop long enough to tell you I believe in you.&rdquo;
Then you went on, and I shall not see you again.</p>
<p>I am writing this from a place I shall leave
before it starts to you. You could not find me if
you had the desire, and so I say to you that which
perhaps I never should have said, if we had
remained in sight of each other in the Blue Mountains.
You are the only man I have ever met
who made me heartsick because I was not worthy
of him, and could not aspire to his level. You
are the only man I have ever loved so much that
it was an ache. You are the only man who told
me by the look in his eyes, that he thought my
life unworthy, and accused me without words
every time we met. I am through with it, and if
it will do you any good to know that your
reproaches have done more than anything else to
cause me to begin all over again, and live a different
life, I want you to have that satisfaction. And
this shall be my only good-by.</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Lily Meredith.</span><span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a long time Joan stood holding the letter
in her hands, and then, as if fathoming its cry
of loneliness, clutched it tightly to her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will find her!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know it!
He must! It wouldn&rsquo;t be kind of heaven to keep
her from him. And he loved her all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far across the peaks of the Blue Mountains
the last rays of the sunset went out, as an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
extinguished torch. A bird near by cheeped
sleepily, and the new night was coming to its own.
Throbbing, rumbling, and grinding in a melody
softened by distance, the roar of the Rattler&rsquo;s
mills became audible, as it brought the yellow
gold, glistening and beautiful, from its sordid
setting of earth. In the camp of the Croix d&rsquo;Or
a chorus was wafted faintly up as men sitting in
the dusk sang: &ldquo;Hearts that are brave and true,
my lads, hearts that are brave and true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently, arm in arm, they gave a last lingering
look at the shaft, the peak above, and turned down
the trail to the camp which seemed all aglow with
rosy light.</p>
